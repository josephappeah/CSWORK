The objective of the game is to stay alive as long as you
can, the longer you stay alive the higher your score will be. 
You will be given a total of 3 lives every time the ship gets hit
you will lose a life. Use the joy stick to control your ship to 
maneuver it away from your enemies. To begin the game hit the 
Cockpit icon to set the serial port, hit the CONTROLS icon to 
calibrate the accelerometer. After calibration you must choice 
which level you want to play and use the sensitivity adjustment 
to adjust the sensitivity that you desire. Also the Motivation icon 
will activate the music and Eject will exit the game.
