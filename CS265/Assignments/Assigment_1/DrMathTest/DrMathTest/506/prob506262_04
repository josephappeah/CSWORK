First convert each quantity to milliliters, using the method I've 
shown you. Before you can do that, you'll have to check what unit is 
being used for water -- you didn't show that. Please write back with 
a carefully labeled attempt to do at least that first step, so we can 
see whether you are learning from what we've told you so far.
