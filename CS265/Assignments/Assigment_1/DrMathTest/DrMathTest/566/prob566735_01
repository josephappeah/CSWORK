Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

This is where logarithms come in very handy:

        x = 4^225
   log(x) = 225*log(4)
   log(x) = 135.463
        x = 10^0.463 * 10^135
          = 2.9 * 10^135

So, 4^225 is roughly 2.9*10^135. Finding the value of 4^225 (even
approximately as we have done) is not going to be possible without a
calculator that can do logarithms or a chart of logarithms.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
