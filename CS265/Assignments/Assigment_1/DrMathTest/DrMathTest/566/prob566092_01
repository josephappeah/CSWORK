Hi Coronel,

Let me show you a trick.  Suppose we make a little substitution, i.e.,
wherever we see '(x-4)', we substitute a 'u'.  Now we have

  5   3   7
  - + - = -
  x   u   x

Now finding the common denominator is pretty straightforward:

  5u   3x   7u
  -- + -- = --
  xu   ux   xu

  5u + 3x = 7u

But now we can just undo the substitution:

  5(x-4) + 3x = 7(x-4)

Now, you don't actually have to _do_ the substitution, if you realize
that any term like (x-4) can be treated like a single number.  (If x
is a number, then subtracting 4 from it gives us another number,
right?)  So we could have just done this:

  5(x-4)     3x     7(x-4)
  ------ + ------ = ------
  x(x-4)   (x-4)x   x(x-4)

Does this make sense?
