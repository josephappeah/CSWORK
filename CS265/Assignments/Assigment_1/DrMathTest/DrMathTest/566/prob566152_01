Hi Christine,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The cold truth about integrals is that
most "natural" functions don't have "natural" integrals.  So whatever
kinds of functions you allow as "natural," there are almost certainly
functions whose antiderivatives are not, although proving that a
particular function has no natural antiderivative is generally very
hard.  See also:

  The Impossibility of Integrating x^x
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51934.html

In your case, that's such a common case (used frequently in
statistics, for example), that somebody decided to give it a name (or
a slight variant), and he called it the "error function," since it is
often used for seeing how far off you might be when you estimate
something with a normal distribution.  See also

So, in that case, the antiderivative would be

  erf(x)*sqrt(pi)/2 + C.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
