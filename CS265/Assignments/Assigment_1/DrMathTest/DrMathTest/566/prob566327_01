I think what you tried to do was to leave just the x on the left. You 
could do this by subtracting 2x (not just 2) from each side -- but 
then you'd be introducing the variable on the other side: x = 15-2x. 
This doesn't help.

When you have two occurrences of the variable, you want to reduce 
that to just one occurrence. In other words, you want to combine the 
two terms into one. How can you combine x + 2x into one term?

You have probably seen how to use the distributive property in 
reverse to combine terms with a common factor:

  3a + 2a = (3+2)a = 5a

Can you do the same thing here? If you're still stuck, remember that 
multiplying anything by 1 does not change it, so you can introduce 
a "phantom 1" whenever it will help: replace x by 1x.
