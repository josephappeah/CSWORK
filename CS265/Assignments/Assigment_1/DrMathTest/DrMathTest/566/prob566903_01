Hi Eric,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You have correctly inserted the
dimensional conversion factors, but you haven't used them, if you
are getting 32 miles/hr/hr.  You need to compute

   32*60*60*60*60      32*60^4
   --------------  or  -------
       5280              5280    ,

and that is not 32  (60^4 is not 5280).

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
