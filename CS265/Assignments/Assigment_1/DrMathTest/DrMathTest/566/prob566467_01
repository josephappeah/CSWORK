Hi Rick.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  Start here:

  Formulas: Sector of a Circle
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.circle.html#sector

If you need more help with this, please write back.  The only
tricky thing will be that you have to be careful that the angle
theta is measured in radians in order to use 

  arc length = radius * theta.

Remember that 180 degrees = pi radians.
