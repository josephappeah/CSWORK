It's easy to prove it the way I suggested, and not at all easy to use
induction on r.  So I still think that it should be proven by
induction on n.  If you insist, though, then you'll probably need to
use the binomial theorem, and you'll probably need some facts about
the binomial coefficients.  Search our archives for "binomial theorem"
(as a phrase) if you are unfamiliar with the theorem.
