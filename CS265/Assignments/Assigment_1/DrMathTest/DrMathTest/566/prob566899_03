You seem to be using "limit" as a verb, and this is non-mathematical
and rather confusing terminology.  If I understand you correctly, you
are saying that you compute the limit as x approaches a by just
substituting x=a into the formula whose limit you are evaluating.
This only "works" if the function f(x) is continuous at x=a, so you
must know that f is continuous at a to apply this logic, otherwise
it is circular reasoning.  For example, if I define
 
          { sin(x)/x    x =/= 0
   S(x) = {    0        x = 0 ,

I cannot assert that 

   lim S(x) = 0
  x->0

by just using the value of S(0).  Since you usually work with 
continuous functions, it "looks" like you compute the limit by
substitution, but the value of the function at the limiting point
x=a, if it even exists, is irrelevant to the question of whether 
the limit exists.  The issue is whether the values f(x) get closer
and closer to some fixed number L as x gets closer and closer to a
(but never equal to a!).

That fact is also the basis of the Cauchy condition.  (Checking some 
of my references, the Cauchy Criterion is a condition on sequences,
analogous to the following condition on functions, so my terminology
was not quite correct.)

If, when x is very close to z, all the values f(x) are very close to 
L, then all the values f(x) have to be close to each other, too.  The 
Cauchy condition says that if 

   lim f(x)
  x->a

exists, then for every positive epsilon (E), there is a delta (D)
such that for all x and y such that 0 < |x-a| < D and 0 < |y-a| < D,

   |f(x) - f(y)| < E.

(Actually, the Cauchy condition is a sufficient condition for a limit
to exist, also, so this is often a way to prove that the limit exists,
even when you don't know its value L.)

I showed you how to find, in every interval (-D,D) points where
g(x) = +1, and points where g(x) = -1, so there are x values which
are both close to 0, at which the function g(x) has values which are
not close to each other, which cannot happen when g(x) has a limit
as x->0.

You can also just show the non-existence of the limit directly.  If
g(x) has a limit L as x->0, then the distance from L to +1 (|L-1|)
and the distance from L to -1 (|L+1|) cannot simultaneously be less
than 1.  That is, for any real number L, either

  |L-1| >= 1,  or  |L+1| >= 1.

Taking epsilon (E) equal to 1, there is no delta (D) such that
0 < |x - 0| < D  implies  |g(x) - L| < E, because for every D, I
showed you how to find a point x where either g(x) = 1 or g(x) = -1,
so that |g(x) - L| < 1 is false (x is a reciprocal of an integer
multiple of pi).
  
If you still have any questions, please write back and I 
will try to explain further.
