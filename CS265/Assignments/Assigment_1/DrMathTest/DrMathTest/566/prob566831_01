Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

You can use the point-slope formula.

Since f is linear, f takes the form:

    f(x) = mx + b

Given two points: (x1,f(x1)) and (x2, f(x2)), you have:

    f(x) - f(x1) = m(x - x1)

The slope can be computed given your two points:

     m = (f(x2) - f(x1)) / (x2 - x1)

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
