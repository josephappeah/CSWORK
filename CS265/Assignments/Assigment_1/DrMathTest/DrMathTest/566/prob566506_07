An area of 16 square feet (taking a nice number nearby) is that of a 4
by 4 foot square. Your soccer ball is over 2 feet across, and its area
is that of 4 circles of that size, which is in the same vicinity. So
the number does make sense.

Areas and volumes ARE easily misjudged, because the numbers get very
large very fast. Who would guess that a 10 by 10 by 10 inch box us
1000 cubic inches? Yet it is! This is just something that you have to
get used to.
