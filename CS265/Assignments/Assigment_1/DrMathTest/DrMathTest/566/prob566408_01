Hi Nia,

When you don't know what to do, a good thing to try is thinking about
a simpler version of the same problem.  For example, suppose I know
that you can walk at 5 miles per hour, and you spend one hour walking.
 How far would you get? 

What about two hours?  Three hours? 

Let me know what you come up with.
