When we say that

    2
  -5  = -25

we are NOT saying that -25 is the square of -5, and so -5 would be 
the square root of -25. Rather, because of the order of operations, 
we are saying that -25 is the negative of the square of 5:

    2      2
  -5  = -(5 ) = -(5*5) = -25

The square of -5 is +25:

      2
  (-5)  = (-5)(-5) = 25

So, for example, if

   2
  x  = -25

then x=-5 is NOT a solution of the equation (which is what would 
have to be true if -25 had a (real) square root.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
