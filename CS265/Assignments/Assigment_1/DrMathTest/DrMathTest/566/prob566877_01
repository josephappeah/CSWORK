Hello Sophie,

If you know only one side of a right triangle, it is impossible to calculate the length of the 
hypotenuse.

In a right triangle with sides a and b and hyp. c, we know that

c^2 = a^2 + b^2.

If we know a or b, we cannot solve this equation for the other two.  There are infinitely 
many possibilities.
