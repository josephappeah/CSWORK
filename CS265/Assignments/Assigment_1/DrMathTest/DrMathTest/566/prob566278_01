Hi Abudahim,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I'm not sure exactly what kind of
formula you are looking for, because the formula for odd factorial is

  7!! = 7*5*3*1

and so on:

  n!! = n*(n-2)*(n-4)*...*3*1.

If you want, you can write this in terms of the regular factorial by
factoring out all of the even terms and pulling a power of two out of
each one:

             (2n+1)!
  (2n+1)!! = --------
             2^n * n!

And even factorial would be:

  (2n)!! = 2^n * n!

You can also use those formulas and Stirling's Formula if you want an
approximate value like Stirling's Formula.

Are any of the above what you wanted?  If you have any questions about
this or need more help, please write back and show me what you have
been able to do, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
