I'm afraid this is still not clear.  Are you restricted to 3 letters 
A, B, C, or could there be other letters D, E, F,..... and when you 
say 3, 4 or 5 do you want separate results for each or the total of 
all three?  What is n in your formula above?  It usually stands for 
the total number of letters from which you choose r.

             n!
  C(n,r) = ------
           r!(n-r)!

equals the number of combinations of r things that can be chosen 
from n different things.

With 5 does this mean combinations like AABBC
                                        AAAAA
                                        AAABB
                                        ABCCC

and if more letters could you have  ABCDE
                                    AABCE  and so on.

The word 'redundant' is misleading.  A better term is 'repeats'. If 
something is redundant it can be left out altogether and I'm sure 
that is not what you mean.

If you give about 5 or 6 examples of exactly what combinations you 
are thinking of and any restriction on the number of different 
letters and restriction on number of repeats for a given letter I 
will try to help.
