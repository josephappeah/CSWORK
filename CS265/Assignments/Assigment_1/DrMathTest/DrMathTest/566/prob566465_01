Hi Lucy,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You just have to try some numbers;
there are 336 solutions, so you'll hit on one of them soon enough.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
