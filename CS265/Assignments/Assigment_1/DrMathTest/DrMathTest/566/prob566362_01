Hi Jean,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Good question.  You *can* complete the
cube or any power, but you can only absorb one term into the cube or
other power.  In the quadratic case, that means you only have a
constant left, which is great, but in the cubic, you will have a
linear term left, so you would get

  3x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + (88 - 160) = 3(x + 2/3)^3 + 8x - 656/9.

Only in special circumstances would the coefficient of the x left over
be zero.  That said, there is a way to "complete the cube" and get a
cubic equation, but it's not easy.  There is another way to get a
cubic equation (also not easy) known as "Cardano's Formula."  The
following Dr Math site describes the second and has a link to a
description of the first.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
