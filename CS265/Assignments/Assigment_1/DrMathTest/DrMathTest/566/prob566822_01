Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

A decent approximation for 2 is the exponent multiplied by roughly 0.3.

The number of digits in a number is given by:

    # of digits = floor( [log(base 10) number] + 1)

For example, 12:  log(base 10) 12 = 1.08
                  1.08 + 1 = 2.08
                  floor(2.08) = 2

So, 12 has 2 digits.

Another, not so obvious example:

    2^128:     log(base 10) 2^128 = 128*[log(base10) 2]
                                  = 128*0.301
                                  = 38.53

This means that 2^128 has 39 digits.

Remember what the logarithm (base 10) represents. It gives you the
nearest power of 10. Since the number of digits simply represents the
value of each power of 10 in a number, the logarithm (base 10) is all
you need.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
