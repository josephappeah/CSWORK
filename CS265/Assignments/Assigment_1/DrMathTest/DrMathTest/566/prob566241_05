Hi Anne.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  A volume is measured
in units that have collectively the units of length-cubed, such
as in^3 or cm^3.

It sounds like you could fit 12666 balls into the prism IF the
balls could squash together perfectly, leaving no space unused.
If they were triangular prisms they might be able to do this, but
since the balls are spheres, there must be some unused space in
between.

In general this is a somewhat tricky problem, but you can search
the internet and our archives for information about "sphere packing".
That should give you lots to work with.
