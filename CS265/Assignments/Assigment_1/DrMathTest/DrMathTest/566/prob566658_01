Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Unfortunately, there's no way of really calculating this sort of
probability. Assuming the birthdays are all random, it is (1/365)^2 =
0.0007%.  But that assumes the birthdays are random. That's definitely
not an assumption you can casually make. 

The probability that this phenomenon occurs at all is actually quite
high. I saw an entry in either a Ripley's book or the Guinness book of
records which recorded a family where 5 family members over 3 or 4
generations shared a birthday. It's the same principle as the lottery.
The chance that any particular person (say John Doe) wins is low, but
the probability that somebody wins is quite high.

The above probability works, however, as long as you make the
assumption that the birthdays are completely random.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
