>(a)Show that the ratio of the areas of bull:inner:outer is 1:3:5.

The areas of the 3 circles are in the ratio 1^2 : 2^2 : 3^2

                                 1 : 4 : 9

Area of "inner" ring = 4 - 1 = 3
Area of "outer" ring = 9 - 4 = 5

So area  bull : inner : outer =  1 : 3 : 5



>(b)If an arow is likely to hit anywhere on the target, wht is the

                        1        1
  Prob hits bull =   ------  =  ---
                      1+3+5      9


>(c)The probability tht Alexander hits the bull inner and outer are

>(1)he shoots 2 arrows.wht is the probability tht they both hit the

      1/10 x 1/10  = 1/100
