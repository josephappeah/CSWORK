Hi, Nae, thanks for writing back.

The first problems you sent were one-step problems; these are two-
step problems. Remember how I said that because the left side of one 
equation, -2+y, was made by adding -2 to y, you had to undo this step 
by subtracting -2? Well, two-step problems work the same way except 
that there are two steps to undo! Let's look at the equation

  3y + 2 = -16

The left side is made from the variable, y, in two steps (following 
the order of operations):

(1) Multiply by 3.
(2) Then add 2.

To undo these two steps, you undo each in REVERSE ORDER:

(2) Subtract 2 (this undoes the "add 2" step).
(1) Divide by 3 (this undoes the "multiply by 3" step).

Why reverse order? It's no mystery, you do it every day. When you get 
dressed, you first put on a sock, then a shoe. When you get undressed 
at the end of the day, first you take off the shoe (undoing the 
SECOND step), then you take off the sock (undoing the FIRST step).

As before, whatever you do to the left side of the equation, you have 
to do the same thing to the right side. Watch me:

  3y + 2 = -16
  3y + 2 - 2 = -16 - 2 (undo the addition of 2)
  3y = -18
  3y/3 = -18/3 (undo the multiplication by 3)
  y = -6

That's the answer. As before, you should CHECK your answer:

  3y + 2 = -16
  3*-6 + 2 = -16
  -18 + 2 = -16
  -16 = -16

It works: the equation is true if we let y = -6.

If you have trouble with subtraction, remember that subtraction is 
just the same as addition of a negative number. For the most part, 
you will do exactly the same things when you have negative numbers as 
when all the numbers are positive; you just need to remember how to 
do operations with negative numbers. Watch me do your second example:

  -10y - 9 = 61 
  -10y - 9 + 9 = 61 + 9
  -10y = 70
  y = 70 / -10
  y = -7

The only tricky part is dividing 70 by -10, remembering that a 
positive divided by a negative is negative.

Your last example can be done two ways. One is to think of 
subtraction of y as addition of -y, and then remember that you can 
get -y by multiplying y by -1:

  -9 - y = -11
  -9 + -1*y = -11

Then it's just the same kind of 2-step problem we've been working 
with; I'll let you finish the work. The other way to do it is a trick 
to get rid of the negative sign: you can add y to both sides! (You'll 
use this same trick soon when you have a variable on both sides of 
the equation, in order to bring them both to the same side.) Watch 
again:

  -9 - y = -11
  -9 - y + y = -11 + y
  -9 = -11 + y

If you subtract any number from -9, then add it back on, you'll get 
-9 back -- no matter what the number is. That's why I can do this 
with a variable, as well as a number: we know the variable stands for 
some number, so we know this will work.

I hope these examples help you in your preparation.
