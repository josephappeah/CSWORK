Hi, Tinos --

You are right -- the problem here is the units.  The bottom line on 
all this is that it makes no sense to compare the surface area 
measurement to the volume measurement, because the units are not the 
same.

If the side of a cube has length x, then

  SA = 6x^2

and

  V = x^3

The ratio of surface area to volume is

  SA/V = 6x^2/x^3 = 6/x

When x=6, this ratio is equal to 1, so the volume and surface area 
are numerically equal.  But when x is less than 6, this ratio is 
bigger than 1, which means the surface area is numerically greater 
than the volume; and when x is greater than 6, this ratio is less 
than 1, which means the surface area is less than the volume.

But the ratio 6/x expressing the ratio of surface area to volume is 
not dimensionless, because it compares square units to cubic units.  
So it is going to be the case that in any cube the surface area may 
be numerically larger than the volume if certain units are used 
while the surface area may be numerically smaller than the volume if 
different units are used.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
