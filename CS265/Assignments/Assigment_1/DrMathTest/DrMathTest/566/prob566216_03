Hello, Yvonne --

I can imagine big red ants moving about 4 cm/sec....  But if the 
given formula gives you a temperature of about 67 degrees Celsius, 
then the formula apprarently does not apply to that species of ant.

As for the correct formulas for different species of ants, I have no 
idea.  You may be able to find something on the internet....
