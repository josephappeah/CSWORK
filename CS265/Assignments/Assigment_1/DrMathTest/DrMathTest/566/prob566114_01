Hi Mary Ann,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  I'm confused by your statement

>[Difficulty]
>the slope of where the line passes thru would be 
>(0,-24) ...


The slope of a line is a number, not a point.  For example, the 
line

   y = 2x - 3

has slope 2.

What kind of line passes through (-2,3) and (-2,27)?  What kind
of line will be perpendicular to it?

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
