Hi Heather,

Suppose I told you that a cake covers an area of 36 square inches on a
plate, and has a volume of 72 cubic inches.  Could you tell me the
height of the cake? 

Here's how I'd find that:

   volume = area * height

  72 in^3 = 36 in^2 * height

  72 in^3
  ------- = height
  36 in^2

     2 in = height

Your problem is basically the same, except the 'height' is going to be
very small.  :^D

Is this enough to get started?
