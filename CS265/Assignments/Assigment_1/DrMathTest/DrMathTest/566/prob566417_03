Hi Christopher,

Well, it was an assumption.  The difference between an assumption and
a mistake is that (stated) assumptions are intentional.  :^D

>That would be too easy. 

Not for a lot of the people who write to us.  

>It was stated that the "win rate" is 86% of games played, not 
>100%. 

But that's ambiguous.  To make it clear, you'd have to say that the
rate has to be exactly 86%.  In most contexts, saying you have a win
rate of 86% means 'at least 86%'.

If you need to get exactly 86%, the condition is

  407 + W          86              W = wins, L = losses
  -----------  =  ---
  474 + W + L     100

  100(407 + W) = 86(474 + W + L)

  40700 + 100W = 40764 + 86W + 86L

          14W = 64 + 86L

                64 + 86L
            W = --------
                   14

                32 + 43L
            W = --------
                   7

So the question is, can we find a value of L that makes (32+43L) a
multiple of 7, in order to get an integer result for W?  In fact,
there are many such values, and you don't even have to look very far
to find them.  For example, when L = 3, 

                32 + 43L   32 + 129   161
            W = -------- = -------- = --- = 23
                   7          7        7

To check, 

  407 + 23       430   5 *  86    86
  ------------ = --- = ------- = ---
  474 + 23 + 3   500   5 * 100   100

In fact, all the values

  L = 3 + 7K,      K = 0, 1, 2, ...

will work.  Can you see why? 

I suspect one reason you weren't able to find this is because you used
decimal representations and a calculator.  That's usually a mistake
when you need exact answers, because calculators have to approximate
most ratios instead of representing them exactly.  (Programs like
Mathematica or Maple are much more clever about this.  But they're
also a lot more expensive!)

So maybe that's the lesson you're supposed to take away from the
problem. :^D

By the way, this kind of equation is called 'Diophantine', and it's a
classic device for expanding the minds of math students:
