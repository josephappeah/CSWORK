Hi John,

I'll give you two or three hints.

As you might have already figured out, finding the cube root of k
is equivalent to solving for the zero of the function f(x) = x^3 - k

Applying Newton's method to the function f(x) gives you a sequence
of estimates for the roots of f: r[0], r[1], r[2], r[3], ...

Of course, what Newton's method actually gives you is a formula
for r[n+1] in terms of r[n], f(r[n]), and f'(r[n]). You've figured
out this formula already, right? If not, figure it out because
you'll definitely need it.

Ok, so here are the hints:

1) What is meant by accuracy? A good measure would be the difference
between consecutive approximations. Since we know that the sequence
r[n] approaches some value, we should expect the difference between
r[n] and r[n+1] to become smaller and smaller as we increase n.
Let's define an 'error' sequence by

  e[n] = r[n+1] - r[n]

If you look carefully at the Newton's method formula, that
difference should look familiar. Use this to your advantage.


2) What does it mean that two numbers x,y are accurate to m decimal
places? If you think about it, they have the same integer part
and they also share the first m decimal places. What happens if
you subtract these two numbers? Think about it enough, and
you'll see it means something like this:

    |x - y| < 10^(-m)

So, mathematically, what the problem is asking you to prove is
the following statement:

    If |e[n]| < 10^(-m), then |e[n+1]| < 10^(-2m)

Proving that can be quite tricky. You should definitely give it
a few attempts. 

3) By the way, this is called "doubling of accuracy" since the
accuracy goes from m to 2m. It is also called "quadratic convergence"
(or second order convergence) since the max error goes from 10^(-m)
to 10^(-2m) = [10^(-m)]^2 (the next max error is the square of the 
previous max error). These keywords should be useful if you want to 
look for hints on the web.


Let us know if you have any more questions.
