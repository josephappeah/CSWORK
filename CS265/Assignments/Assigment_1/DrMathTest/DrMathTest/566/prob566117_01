Hi Graeme,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You can certainly do it without
modular arithmetic by lining up 120 people (or other items), numbered,
and chanting 119 time.

First you should count the beats in the chant to find out how many
people you'll pass each time you eliminate one.  Then you see who gets
eliminated after one complete pass around the circle (I get 0 mod 16,
but it will depend on how you count the beats).  Go around again (8
mod 17?), and so on.  Sometimes you might get one residue up to some
point and then another past that point.  Of course, after most of the
numbers are gone, then you can easilty count out the rest of them.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
