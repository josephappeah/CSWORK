Hi Joe,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Actually, your first question is
still essentially a matter of understanding the definition and meaning
of a logarithm.  If you understand that, it should be obvious.

Try reading the following archived answer and see if you can then
answer the question.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
