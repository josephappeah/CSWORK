Hi,

The first problem requires your replacement rules (which you already 
used) and then just Hypothetical Syllogism (where you HYPOTHESIZE the 
first part of the conditional and derrive the second) and disjunctive 
syllogism.  Just follow the steps I showed and you'll be fine.

For this problem, you should see that what you are trying to prove is 
identical to (~I -> K)

So do another hypothetical syllogism.  Assume ~I and derrive K.

For starters, if we assume ~I, we can get ~G with a little work on the 
first given.

We can change the third given to:

  (~((~L v ~G) ^ M) v N)

Which can be further changed to:

  ((~(~L v ~G) v ~M) v N)

Or:

  ((~(~L v ~G) v (~M v N))

Or

  (((L -> ~G) -> (M -> N))

And now we have

  ~G

already.  From ~G, we are free to conclude:

  (L -> ~G)

By a rather simple hypothetical syllogism.

Then by modus ponens we can get:

  (M -> N)

Which can get us to:

  (L ^ J)

Can you finish from there?
