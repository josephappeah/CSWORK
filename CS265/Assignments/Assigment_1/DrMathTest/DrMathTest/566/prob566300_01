Hi Majid,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I would start like this:

First show that phi(n) is always even for n>2.  So it looks like n
must be even, too.  Now show that phi(n) <= n/2 when n is even.  Use
this to conclude that

  phi(n) = n-2 implies n <= 4.

Then check all the values n = 1,2,3,4.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
