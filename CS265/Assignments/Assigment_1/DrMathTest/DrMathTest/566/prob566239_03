Hi again, Charlie.

Suppose you have N teams and you want to guarantee that each team
plays at least K games (where K is equal to N-1 or less).  Then the
total number of matches is N*K/2.  This number is rounded up to the
next higher number if N and K are both odd.  The division-by-two
comes from the fact that each match needs two participants.

Example:  5 teams (ABCDE) with at least 3 games each.
This could be accomplished with 5*3/2 = 7.5 -> eight matches:

  A v B, C v D
  A v E, B v C
  A v D, B v E
  C v E, D v B       team B gets a fourth game

Example:  6 teams (ABCDEF) with 3 games each.
This can be accomplished with 6*3/2=9 -> nine matches:

  A v B, C v D, E v F
  A v C, B v E, D v F
  A v D, B v F, C v E

Example:  7 teams (ABCDEFG) with 3 games each.
This can be accomplished with 7*3/2 = 21/2 = 10.5 -> eleven matches:

  A v B, C v D, E v F
  G v A, B v C, D v E
  F v G, A v C, B v D
  E v G, F v (ABCD)          You can choose any one of {ABCD} to
                             get an extra game.

The number of columns in these tables is the number of playing fields
that you have.  You may have fewer than what I've assumed, in which
case you may have to reschedule a bit.
