If you multiply the equation by the LCD, you will eliminate 
fractions. If you have factored each denominator (which you didn't 
show), then you can use those factors to find the LCD, or simply 
multiply by one factor at a time until you have eliminated all 
denominators.

(Incidentally, you should be a little more careful when writing 
equations. You left out the "=" sign, and you didn't use parentheses 
around what I presume are meant to be denominators, such as x^2-
6x+9, so that what you wrote does not mean what you intended -- 
think about the order of operations.)

If you need more help, please write back and show me how far you got.
