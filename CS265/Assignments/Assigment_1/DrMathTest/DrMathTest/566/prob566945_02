Hi Kasey,
I'm glad to see that Dr. Ian answered your question.
 
Here Is something else that may be interesting to you, even
though it does not really answer your question.  Because you
are interested in math, you may also like science.  Here is
a way to remember the planets in our solar system.  I heard
about this last week, and I wanted to tell someone about it.
 "My very educated mother just served us nine pizzas." 
M is for Mercury
V is for Venus
E is for Earth
M is for Mars
J is for Jupiter
S is for Saturn
U is for Uranus
N is for Neptune
P is for Pluto
  
The only trick is to remember which "M" planet comes first.
