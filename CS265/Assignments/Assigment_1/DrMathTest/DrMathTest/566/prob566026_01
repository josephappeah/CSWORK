Hi Aini,

To determine whether a number is even or not, we divide it by 2 and
see if there is a remainder.  For example, if we divide 37 by 2, 

      18
    ____
  2 ) 37
      2
      --
      17
      16
      --
       1  <-- remainder

we get a remainder, so 37 is odd.  On the other hand, if we divide 24
by 2, we get no remainder.  

What happens when you divide 1 by 2?  What about when you divide 0 by 2?
