Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

I think the following section of the Dr. Math FAQ will help:

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.triangle.html

Try out Heron's formula in the Scalene triangle section.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
