Rita,

There are two relationships involving the trains.  We know that

     Distance = Rate * Time.

The first relationship uses the fact that the trains take different lengths of time to travel 
the same distance; specifically, the slow train takes 67 minutes to make the trip, and the 
fast train takes 46 minutes to travel the same distance.  So letting R represent the fast 
train's speed, and r the slow train's speed, we have

     46R = 67r,
or
     R/r = 67/46.

This makes sense since the fast train is 67/46ths as fast as the slow train.

The second relationship describes the number of minutes it takes for the fast train to 
catch up to the slow train.  If we let t represent this value, then the time at which this 
occurs is 9:37 + t minutes, since the fast train leaves at 9:37am.  To set this equation up, 
we must consider how much of a head start the slow train was given; that is, how far it has 
traveled in the 17 extra minutes it had to start the journey.  Remembering that the slow 
train's speed is r, we find that it has traveled a distance of 17r by 9:37 am, when the fast 
train has just begun to leave.

At t minutes after 9:37, the trains are now caught up; that is, they have traveled the same 
distance.  The slow train has traveled an additional distance of rt, so its total distance 
traveled up to time t is 17r + rt = (17+t)r.  Furthermore, the fast train has now traveled a 
distance of Rt, and so these distances are equal:

     (17+t)r = Rt.

Since we know that R/r = 67/46, we seek to employ this ratio in the above equation to 
eliminate the quantities R and r, leaving only t; to this end, we divide both sides by r to 
obtain

     17 + t = (R/r)t,

which allows us to make the desired substitution to find

     17 + t = (67/46)t,
or

     (21/46)t = 17,
or
     t = 782/21 minutes,

which is equivalently 37 minutes, 14 and 2/7ths of a second.  Thus the fast train has 
caught up to the slow train and will pass it at around

     10:14'14" am.

(You may want to check my arithmetic to make sure I have done it correctly!)
