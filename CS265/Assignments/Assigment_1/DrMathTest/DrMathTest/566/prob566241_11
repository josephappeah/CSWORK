Ok Anne.

let's start over.  Tell me the statement of the problem as you 
understand it, as precisely as possible, then show me your
reasoning to where you've gotten, and then try to indicate what
aspects of your attempted solution are still giving you problems.

Learning how to restate the problem in this manner is actually 
a fairly important skill.
