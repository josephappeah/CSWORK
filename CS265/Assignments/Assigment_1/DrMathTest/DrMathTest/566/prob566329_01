Use logarithms to obtain the size of the answer and the first three
digits:

Let x = 1999^2000

Using log to mean "log base 10", we have

log x = 2000(log 1999) = 2000(3.30081279412) = 6601.62558824

x = 10^6601(10^.62558824) = 10^6601(4.22268...)

Thus the first three digits are 422.  How many decimal places are there?
