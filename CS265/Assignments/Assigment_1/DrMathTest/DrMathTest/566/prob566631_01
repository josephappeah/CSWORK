Adam,
Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The truth is, if you wanted to work
out digits of an irrational number by hand, you would do it exactly
the same way a calculator (or computer) does it: Newton's Method.

Newton's Method is an algorithm for finding roots of a function.  It's
based on a Taylor Series expansion of the function.  Without knowing
how much calculus you've had, I'm not going to dive in to the details
of how Newton's Method works.  But I will provide you with a basic
outline of the algorithm.

Suppose you want to calculate the root of a function f(x).  You start
with an initial guess, x_0.  Then, you compute successives guess by
the formula:

 x_{k + 1} = x_k - f(x_k) / f'(x_k)

where f'(x) is the derivative of your function.  Let's apply this to a
concrete example, namely square roots.  Suppose you wanted to find
square root of S (which I'll write as sqrt(S)) where S is positive. 
We set up a function such that sqrt(S) is the root of that function:

 f(x) = x^2 - S

We can verify that sqrt(S) is a root of this function:

 f(sqrt(S)) = (sqrt(S))^2 - S
            = |S| - S            Don't forget the absolute value bars!
            = S - S              Because we know S is positive
            = 0

The only other thing we need to know is the derivative of our
function, f'(x).  If you've taken calculus, you know the derivative is
given by:

 f'(x) = 2x

So we can set up our iteration as follows:

                   x_k^2 - S 
 x_{k + 1} = x_k - ---------
                    2 * x_k

                   x_k      S
           = x_k - --- + -------
                    2    2 * x_k

             x_k      S
           = --- + -------
              2    2 * x_k

             1           S
           = - * (x_k - ---)
             2          x_k

You can easily verify that this iteration terminates at x = sqrt(S). 
Let x_k = sqrt(S) and you'll find that x_{k + 1} = sqrt(S).

Newton's Method, as I've described it, doesn't always work.  But you
can enhance it to guarantee global convergence.  It helps if you have
a good starting point.  One of the great things about Newton's Method
is that, once you get close to a solution, it converges very rapidly.
 In fact, the number of correct digits doubles at every iteration. 
This is called quadratic convergence.

As for computing pi, there are several methods, some faster than
others.  We don't actually use Newton's Method for computing pi, but
most of the methods still rely on Taylor Series expansion.  Probably
the best known formula for pi is the Gregory-Leibniz formula:

 pi = 4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...)

This comes from the Taylor Series expansion of the arctangent
function.  Unfortunately, this series converges very slowly.  People
have come up with others.  For example, it can be shown that:

 pi = arctan(1/2) + arctan(1/3)

So if you can numerically evaluate the arctangent function, you can
compute pi like this.

Really, it all boils down to Taylor Series.  They're our best tool for
computing approximation of irrational numbers.  The number, e (the
base of the natural logarithm) can also be computed using a Taylor Series.

Let me know if you have any more questions about this.  Your best bet
would be to brush up on the Taylor Remainder theorem in any good
second semester calculus text.
