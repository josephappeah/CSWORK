Hi Kirstie,
Thanks for writing to Dr. Math!

Are you working with a cube, where all the sides (Length, Width, and 
Height) are equal?

The volume of a cube is:

  L * W * H = Volume of a Cube

We said the sides (s) of a cube are of equal length, so the formula 
above can also be written as:

  s * s * s = Volume of a Cube, or
  
      s^3   =  Volume of a Cube.

So for your problem, we have the equation:

      s^3 = 1000 cm^3

Do you know how to solve a problem with a cube function in it?  
(What operation undoes the cube function?)

Another way to answer this question is to find what number multiplied 
by itself three times will give you the answer 1000.
  


Does this help?
Please write back if you need anything else.
