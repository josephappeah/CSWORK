Gill,
For this problem, you're going to need the compound interest formula.
 The most general form of the compound interest formula is:

 F = P * (1 + r / n)^(n * t)

Where F is the future value, P is the present value (or principle), r
is the interest rate, n is the number of compounding periods per year
and t is the number of years.  For your specific problem, we know that
r = .04 and n = 1, so let's just plug those numbers in now to simplify
things:

 F = P * 1.04^t

Here's how were going to go about solving this problem.  We'll look at
option 1 and determine the future value of both of those payments in
10 years.  Why 10 years?  Option 2 has a payment in 10 years, so we
need to go that far in to the future.  Then we'll go back to option 2
and figure out what those payments have to be in order to equal the
future value of option 1.  It sounds like a lot, but we'll take it
step by step.

We begin with option 1.  You pay $400 in 4 years and $700 in 7 years.
 Let's take each payment in turn.  If we're looking at the future
value in 10 years, the $400 payment will have 10 - 4 = 6 years to
grow.  If we apply the compound interest formula from above, we get
the future value:

 F_1 = 400 * 1.04^6

I use the subscript 1 to indicate this is the future value of the
first payment.  We can do the same thing with the 2nd payment (it has
10 - 7 = 3 years to grow):

 F_2 = 700 * 1.04^3

If we put them together, we get the total future value of both
payments in 10 years:

 F = F_1 + F_2
   = 400 * 1.04^6 + 700 * 1.04^3
   = 1293.53

OK, so there's our goal.  Now let's work on option 2.  You make a
payment of $X after 5 years and $3X after 10 years.  Again, we take
each payment in turn.  The first payment has 5 = 10 - 5 years to grow
so its future value is:

 F_1 = X * 1.04^5

The 2nd payment has 10 - 10 = 0 years to grow so its future value is:

 F_2 = 3X * 1.04^0
     = 3X

So the total future value of both payments for option 2 is:

 F = F_1 + F_2
   = X * 1.04^5 + 3X

So now you have 2 formulas for the future value in 10 years.  If you
set them equal, you'll have 1 equation and 1 unknown (X) for which you
can solve.  That will tell you your payments for option 2.

Let me know if you have any more questions about this interesting problem.
