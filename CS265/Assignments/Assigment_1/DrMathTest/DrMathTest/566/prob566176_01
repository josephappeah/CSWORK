Hi Steven.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

I think the following diagram will help:

   A---B---C    AB = BC = radius
   |\  |  /|    BD = height of emitter from aperture (ABC)
   | \ | / |    @ = angle ADC = beam angle (e.g. 5 deg)
   |  \|/  |
   |   D   |
   |       |

The relation that connects the radius with the height is found from
trigonometry:

   tan(@/2) = radius/height,

from which you can easily solve for the radius.  

Please write back if I misunderstood your question.
