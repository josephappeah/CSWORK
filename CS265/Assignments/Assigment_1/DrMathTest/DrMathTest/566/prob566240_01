Hi Sha-Ronda,

The tricky part here will be representing the diagonal.  And you'll
have more luck if you don't try to do too much at once, but instead
take things one step at a time. 

Let's look at a rectangle, with width W and length L:

  A-----------B
  |           |
  |           | W
  |           |
  D-----------C
       L

What is the length of the diagonal?  (That's the distance from A to C,
or from D to B.)  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find that:

   diagonal^2 = L^2 + W^2

                  _________
     diagonal = \/L^2 + W^2

(If that doesn't look familiar, let me know.  The Pythagorean Theorem
is pretty important to know, as it shows up in a lot of different
places.) 

Okay, so now let's look at the problem again:

  If the width of a rectangle is 1 inch less than its length 
  and the diagonal is 1 inch longer than its length, find the 
  length.

We've already decided to represent the width and length with W and L,
so we can just substitute those in:

  If W is 1 inch less than L 
  and the diagonal is 1 inch longer than L, find L.

And we've noted that the diagonal is sqrt(L^2 + W^2).  So let's
substitute that in:

  If W is 1 inch less than L 
  and sqrt(L^2+W^2) is 1 inch longer than L, find L.

The first part tells us that

  W = L - 1

Do you see why?  The second part tells us that

  sqrt(L^2+W^2) = L + 1

So we have two equations, with two variables.  Can you take it from here? 

Note how I didn't just try to read the problem and write down the
relevant equations.  That hardly ever works.  It's much safer to start
with the English words, and translate them to symbols a little at a
time, so that after each part of the translation you can look at
everything and see that it still says the same thing it said before,
only using different symbols.
