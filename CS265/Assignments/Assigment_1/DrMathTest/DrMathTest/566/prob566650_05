So the question is how to interpret the fraction, right?  You should
calculate the modular inverse of the denominator (such as by the
Extended Euclidean Algorithm) and multiply the numerator by the
modular inverse.  That is how you interpret the fraction.  You will
get the same answer if you divide 130 by 8 (inverse of 8 mod 169 is
148, and 130 * 148 = 143 mod 169) and then add 4, or if you add the
number 4 = 32/8 to the fraction 130/8, to get 162/8, and then divide
162/8.

Is that what you wanted to know?  Did this clear it up?
