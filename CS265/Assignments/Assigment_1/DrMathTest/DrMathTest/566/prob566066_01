You can bring the train to rest by imposing a velocity of 50 mph 
backwards on the whole system.  So train is at rest and the car has 
velocity 10 mph.  Time for the car to travel 1 mile at 10 mph

   = 1/10 hours  =  6 minutes



How far will they have traveled from the time the car reaches

In 1/10 of an hour the train, at 50 mph, would travel

      50 x 1/10  = 5 miles

The car will have travelled 6 miles.
