Hi Jojoproto,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  There is not a general solution to
such a functional inequality, for the reason that the space of
functions that satisfy that inequality is HUGE - you might be able to
prove that it has the same cardinality as the space of real-valued
functions, which is at least as big as the cardinality of the power
set of real numbers.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
