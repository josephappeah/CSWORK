Hi Steven,

According to 

  http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Polya.html

Polya was better known for his contributions to math education than to
mathematics itself.  

However, since most 7th grade math teachers (and perhaps most authors
of 7th grade math texts) have never heard of George Polya, it's hard
to say that he's had any effect at all on 7th grade math.  

But if you have to write a report about this, you could probably get
away with saying that he "influenced the way educators think about
math education", and leave it at that.
