Hi Ashley,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  That's what we call a transcendental
equation, and there is no easy way to solve for the solutions.  So you
have to use numerical methods, such as iteration or Newton's Method,
or others.  Newton's method would say to start at some value like

  w = 2

and then to change w to

  w - (w + tan 0.8w)/(1 - 0.8sec^2 w)

and repeat.  It should get closer and closer to the correct value,
rather quickly.  (Starting with w=1 will end up getting close to 0,
which is not the solution you want.)

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
