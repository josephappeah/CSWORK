Hi Vijay,

That's a really good question!  The answer is that you have the
implication backwards.  It's not 

  If two lines are perpendicular, 
  then the product of their slopes is -1. 

It's really

  If the product of the slopes of two lines is -1,
  then the lines are perpendicular. 

Do you see the difference?  What makes the difference in wording
important is that some lines don't have slopes - in particular, the
slope of any vertical line is undefined.  

Suppose we have a line like x=3, which is vertical.  We want to
compute the slope of the line, so we choose two points on the line,
say (3,1) and (3,2).  The slope is the change in y divided by the
change in x, 

          change in y   2 - 1   1
  slope = ----------- = ----- = - = undefined
          change in x   3 - 3   0

So the slope of the line is undefined.  Does this mean it can't be
perpendicular to other lines?  Not at all!  Any vertical line is
perpendicular to any horizontal line... which means that the x-axis
and the y-axis are perpendicular, even though the slope of the y-axis
is undefined.  

If we say

  If two lines are perpendicular, 
  then the product of their slopes is -1.

then we're saying the only way a line can be perpendicular to another
line is if it has a slope.  But if we say 

  If the product of the slopes of two lines is -1,
  then the lines are perpendicular. 

we're saying that this is one possible way to determine whether two
lines are perpendicular, but we're not insisting that every pair of
perpendicular lines has to pass this test. 

Does that make sense?
