Hi Lisa,

Are you asking about fractions other than 2004/infinity?  

Strictly speaking, 2004/infinity isn't a fraction, because in a
fraction, both the numerator and denominator must be numbers (or
variables, which represent numbers).  And 'infinity' isn't a number,
although the symbol we use for it sort of makes it look like one. 

However, some people (including math teachers) misuse 

  something/infinity

to mean 'zero', since if you keep dividing by bigger and bigger
numbers, you get closer and close to zero.  The same people often 

  something/0

to mean 'infinity', since if you keep dividing by smaller and smaller
numbers, you get larger numbers as a result.  

But both these uses of infinity are incorrect, and you should take
care _not_ to learn them, because they can cause you all kinds of
problems later on. 

Does this help?  Write back if you'd like to talk more about this, or
anything else.
