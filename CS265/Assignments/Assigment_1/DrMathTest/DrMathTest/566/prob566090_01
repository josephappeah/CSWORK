Hi Marilyn.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

The only formula we need is the following:

   circumference = 2 * pi * radius,

where pi is a constant approximately equal to 3.14.  The distance
away from the tree is the difference in radii between the tree's
radius and the edging radius.   We know the circumferences of the
tree and the edging, and can compute the two radii from them by 
applying the equation above:

  Tree:   r = c/(2*pi) = (4 ft)/(2*3.14) = 0.64 ft
  Edging: R = C/(2*pi) = (11.5 ft)/(2*3.14) = 1.83 ft

These are the radii of the circles of the tree and edging, and the
difference between them (which is the spacing all around) is

  R - r = 1.83 ft - 0.64 ft = 1.19 ft
                            = 1.19 ft x (12 inch/ft)
                            = 1 ft 2.33 inch

I hope that this helps.  If you are still confused by this, please
write back.
