Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

There are a couple problems with creating a true circle. The first is
the particular nature of the universe. The pen/pencil we use puts down
ink/graphite on the paper. These substances are composed of molecules.
And empty space exists between molecules. So, we can never really get
a true circle since we can't make a continuous curve. The other
problem is in measuring devices. The Uncertainty Principle ensures
that our measuring devices will always have an inherent ultimate
precision. So, there is a theoretical maximum precision to which we
can measure pi.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
