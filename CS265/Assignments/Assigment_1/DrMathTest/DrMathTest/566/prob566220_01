Hi Rick.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

Water cannot be created nor destroyed in this system, so the flow
rate has to be the same at the beginning as it is at the end:
130 liter/sec.

In the split, the area of the two smaller pipes is smaller than the
area of either the starting or the ending pipes, so in the region
where there are two pipes, the velocity of the fluid will be faster
(to compensate for the smaller area), but the flow rate there will
still be the same:  130 liter/sec.
