Hi, Jonathan --

We know that for n>7, f(n)>1.

And we found f(8)=8; f(9)=3; f(10)>2; f(11)<2.

And a bit of analysis using any of a number of methods shows that 
the function is always decreasing for n > 7.

So we can conclude that

  1 < f(n) < 2  for all n > 10

And so the only integer values of the function are the ones we 
already found for n=1, 8, and 9.
