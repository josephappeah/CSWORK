Hi K,

It turns out that, for a lot of reasons, it's really useful to be able
to break numbers down into factors.  For example, here are some of the
ways we can break 12 into factors:

  12 = 12 * 1

     = 6 * 2

     = 4 * 3

     = 2 * 2 * 3

This last way is especially interesting, because none of the factors
(2, 2, 3) can be broken into smaller factors.  What's even more
interesting is that this set of factors (2, 2, 3) is _unique_ to 12. 
No other number has the same set of factors. 

This turns out to be so important that we've given it a pretty
important-sounding name: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which
says that for any natural number, there is only one way to get the
number by multiplying prime numbers together.  

Now, if we defined the prime numbers to include 1, the Fundamental
Theorem of Arithmetic would no longer be true.  Why?  Because we could
keep generating new 'prime factorizations':

  12 = 1 * 2 * 2 * 3

     = 1 * 1 * 2 * 2 * 3

     = 1 * 1 * 1 * 2 * 2 * 3

and so on.  So this is why we don't include 1 in the prime numbers. 

I hope this answers your question.  If you have any more, let me 
know!
