Hi Fransisca,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You have been given an expression
which combines several numbers with parentheses, plus and minus signs,
and a multiplication sign.  The result of doing all these operations
will be a single number, and that is what you are supposed to find.

There is an 'agreement' about how to interpret the expression as a
sequence of arithmetic operations, sometimes called "PEMDAS".  See

   http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.order.operations.html

and the links on that page for more information and examples.  You
can also search our Archives with the keyword PEMDAS to find more
examples in answers to earlier questions.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
