The metric system has been around for quite a while. Different 
countries and different people would do things just a bit 
differently -- for example, we used to talk about "microns" as a unit 
in the metric system, equal to 1/1,000,000 of a meter, using just the 
Greek letter mu as its symbol. But we also have the unit "micrometer" 
which means the same thing, and uses mu-m as its symbol (mu for micro-
 followed by m for meters). Some people might use periods after the 
symbols, little things like that.

The Systeme International d'Unites or SI is the result of 
international conferences to standardize the metric system. It sets 
rules to tighten up on those things that people did differently in 
different places. Thus the SI is one particular metric system, one 
that has everything we need, but there are metric units ("old" units) 
that are not part of the SI, such as microns and angstroms. Also, the 
SI includes the exact definitions of the base units -- exactly how 
long is a meter, for example?
