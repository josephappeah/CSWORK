Hi Christine,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Unfortunately for you, I'm going to
have to side with your boyfriend on this one.  The number

  1.9999999...

is the limiting value of that series that you described as "tending to
2 but never reaching 2" - that is, it means the thing that it's
tending to.  So that number is another way of writing 2.  See also

  0.9999... = 1

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
