Thank you for your comments. Certainly practical mathematics does not 
require mathematical exactness, and you can do fine without ever 
thinking about the Greek geometers and their effort to trisect an 
angle. Since you are not interested in what they were trying to do 
(which is what has been proved impossible), I think the discussion is 
closed.

I just hope, though, that since we agree that people aren't just 
intellectual thinking organs, you will have the human wisdom not to 
call someone a moron just because he has interests that you do not 
share.
