Hi Nat,

Suppose I'm inviting some people to dinner.  I need to spend $15 on
stuff that I'll use regardless of how many people show up; and then
I'll spend $10 for each person who shows up.  My cost is a linear
function:

  cost = $15 + $10*(number of people)

I could use this function to generate cases,

   people (x)     cost (y)
   ----------     --------
       0             15
       1             25
       2             35
       3             45

and so on.  If I plot these on a graph, all the (people,cost) pairs
will lie on a line... which is why it's called a linear function. 

In fact, if you look at the function,

  cost = $15 + $10*(number of people)

  cost = $10*(number of people) + $15

     y =   m*x                  + b

Does this look familiar? 

You're trying to set up the same kind of thing.  What you need to do
is figure out what corresponds to y, to x, to m, and to b.  

Is this enough to get started?
