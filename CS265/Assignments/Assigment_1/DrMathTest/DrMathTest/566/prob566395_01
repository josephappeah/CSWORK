6 feet, 3 1/2 inches.

Why would you _want_ to?  You could divide 3 1/2 by 12 to get 

       0.2 9 1
      ________
  12 ) 3.5 0 0
       2 4
       ---
       1 1 0
       1 0 8
       -----
           2 0
           1 2
           ---
             8 ...

but if you told someone that Brian is 6.29 feet, they'd just have to
convert it back to inches to understand what you were talking about. 

You might think of it this way:  3 inches is 1/4 of a foot, so Brian is 

     6 ft + 1/4 ft  + (1/2)(1/12) ft

   = 6 ft + 0.25 ft + 1/24 ft

and 1/24 is pretty close to 1/25, which is 4%, giving

   = 6 ft + 0.25 ft + 0.04 ft (approximately)

   = 6.29 feet (approximately)

      
>I said 3 1/2 inches by adding the 2 inches and the 1 1/2 inches.

It's right, but somewhat pointless.  Also, you'd want to truncate the
decimal expansion, since including decimal places suggests that you
measured him to the nearest millionth of an inch.  :^D

Does this help?
