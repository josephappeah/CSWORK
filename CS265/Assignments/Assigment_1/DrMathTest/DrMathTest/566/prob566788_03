Hi Mitropam,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Most proofs do require more words than
mathematical notations.  I won't give you a complete proof; that's
your job.  But I'll give you some advice (and, frankly, this is pretty
close to a complete proof, after the two points I mentioned last time):

Since the limit of

  n^(1/n)

is 1, that means that for every (small) positive number e you choose,
you will have

  1 < n^(1/n) < 1+e

whenever n is bigger than some number N depending on e.  Now suppose that

  n > M > N

for some other big number M.  Then adding up n terms will get you

  S = 1^(1/1) + 2^(1/2) + ... + n^(1/n)
  S1 = 1^(1/1) + 2^(1/2) + ... + N^(1/N)
  S2 = (N+1)^(1/(N+1)) + ... + n^(1/n)
  S = S1 + S2

Now S1 has N terms in it, each of which is no bigger than

  3^(1/3) < 3/2

So that means that

  S1 < (3/2)*N

and S2 has n-N terms in it, each of which is no bigger than 1+e, so
that means that

  S2 < (n-N)*(1+e)

and therefore

  S = S1 + S2 < (3/2)*N + (n-N)*(1+e)

and then the limit you want is

  S/n < (3/2)*N/n + (1 - N/n)*(1+e)
      < 1 + e + 3N/2n

if you let e be a little smaller than you need, and then let M be much
bigger than N (so that n is much bigger than N), then you can make
this as close to 1 as you'd like.
