Hi Patrick,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You are on the right track, but 
your decomposition of the integral isn't quite correct.  The
absolute value |a| of a number is always either a (if a >= 0) or
-a (if a < 0), so if you know the sign of a quantity a, you can
write |a| without the absolute value signs.  This is the property 
you are trying to use, but you haven't paid any attention to 
the sign of the polynomial quantity inside the absolute value 
signs.

Where is 

   (x-1)(3x-1) = 0 ?

The points where the polynomial is 0 are the only points where it
can change sign, so it has to have a constant sign between these
points.  If a function f(x) has a root at c, where a < c < b,
and f is continuous on [a,b], and if f(x) > 0 for a < x < c while
f(x) < 0 for c < x < b, then

   b              c          b
  /             /           /
  | |f(x)| dx = | f(x)dx  - | f(x) dx  .
  /             /           /
  a             a           c

You need to analyze the sign of (x-1)(3x-1) in order to
decompose the integral into integrals of this polynomial
without absolute value signs.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
