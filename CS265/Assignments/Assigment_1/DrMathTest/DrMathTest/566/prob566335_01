Good thinking.  It depends on the game, but is it something like this?
 You pick a number from 1 to 5, and you're either right or not.  And
you do this twice, even if you're right the first time. And you want
to know what your chance is of choosing correctly at least once. 

Is that more or less what's going on?  

If so, note that the probability that you get it right, plus the
probability that you don't get it right, must add up to 100%.  (Those
are the only two choices.)

So what has to happen for you to get two wrong choices?  You have a
4/5 probability of being wrong; and you'd have to be wrong twice in a
row.  The probability of that is

  (4/5) * (4/5) = 16/25

                = 64/100

                = 64%

So the probability of getting it right at least once is 100% minus
64%, or 36%.  If you choose 5 times, the probability of missing all 5 is 

  (4/5)^5 = about 0.33

or about 1/3.  So given 5 tries, you have a 2-out-of-3 chance of
picking correctly. 

Does this make sense?
