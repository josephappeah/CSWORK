Hi Linda,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  In your argument, you state

>Let b^r be an element in B(r)...

I'm not sure why you say "let ...".  It is just an observation that
b^r belongs to B(r)={b^t: t rational and t <= r}, since t=r satisfies
the two conditions "t rational and t <= r".  "Let..." usually means to
assume something hypothetically, but here, you just verify that the
statement is true.

When an upper bound u of a set B belongs to the set B, then u must
be the least upper bound of B, because if v is any other upper bound
of B, then u <= v since u belongs to B.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
