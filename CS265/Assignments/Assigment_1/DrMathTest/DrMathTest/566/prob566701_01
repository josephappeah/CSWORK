The surface area of an entire sphere is 4 pi r^2  (the r value is squared),
so an upper limit for the area would be this:

4 pi (17.5)^2 = 3847 square feet (approximately).

Here's a way to obtain the exact value.  Go to the "dome calculator"
here:

    http://www.desertdomes.com/domecalc.html

and select the type of dome you want (maybe it's a "3V"?)

Type in the radius and you'll obtain the lengths of the edges of
the triangles.  Using the diagram, you can figure out how many
of each kind of triangle you have and work out the areas of
each using Heron's formula (which I'll show you below).  Add
them up, and there you go!

If you just want a pretty good estimate, you can use the largest
length and assume the triangles are equilateral of that length
and just get their area and multiply by the number of triangles.

The website is meant for building temporary "tent domes" where
the edges are pipe and it's covered with cloth or something, but
the lengths of pipe will be the lengths of the edges you want
for a permanent structure.

Heron's formula:

If the three sides of a triangle have lengths a, b and c, then
first calculate s = (a + b + c)/2  (the semi-perimeter -- half-way
around the triangle) and the area is given by this formula:

A = square_root(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))

For your equilateral upper bound approximation, a = b = c, so
s = (3/2)a and the area is

A = square_root(3a^4/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)(a^2) = .866 a^2

I know that the dome calculator works, since I've built 4
domes (of the tent variety) using its calculations.

Good luck!
