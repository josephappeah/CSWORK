Hi Michelle.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

A square foot is a unit of area, and so is a SQUARE inch:

   1 sq ft = 1 ft x 1 ft = (12 inch) x (12 inch) = 144 sq inch

But to convert a square foot (area) to an inch (length) doesn't make
sense, unless you have some other specified reference length (such 
as the width of a carpet roll, say 8 ft):

  10 sq ft = (8 ft) x (? inch)
  
  answer:  ? = 10 sq ft / (8 ft)
             = 1.25 ft x ft / ft
             = 1.25 ft
             = 1.25 ft x [12 inch/ft]         conversion factor
             = 15 inch

I hope this helps.
