Hi Denton,

When we want to indicate that we're multiplying some variables, 

  x times y times z

we just put them next to each other, with no punctuation:

  x times y times z = xyz

We can do this with a number and a variable, and it's not ambiguous:

  3 times x times y = 3xy

But if we want to use more than one number, this doesn't work:

  243xy = 2 times 4 times 3 times x times y?

        = 24 times 3 times x times y?

        = 2 times 43 times x times y?

        = ...

In this case, we use parentheses to indicate where one number stops,
and the next begins:

  5(4)(8) = 5 times 4 times 8

Note that you could also write it in any of the following ways:

  (5)(4)(8) 
  
  (5)4(8)
  
  5(4)8

  (5)(4)8

Does this help?
