Hi Kranti,

If I understand you correctly, you're trying to find the number of
permutations of the set.  For example, suppose we have sets 

  A = { 1, 2, 3 }

and 

  B = { Moe, Larry, Curly }

One possible 1:1 mapping is

   1,   2,     3 
   |    |      |
   Moe, Larry, Curly 

We could rearrange the elements of A, and that would give us another
mapping:

   2,   1,     3 
   |    |      |
   Moe, Larry, Curly 

If we count _all_ the ways we can arrange the elements of A, that
would tell us how many possible mappings there are, right?  The number
of ways the elements of a set can be arranged is called the number of
'permutations' of the set.  You can find out how to compute that by
looking at our FAQ:

Does this help?
