Hi Craig,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Since this appears to be beyond a
first course in calculus, you should be familiar with L'Hospital's
Rule.  For limits which are indeterminate forms, a method which 
often works to to rewrite or relate the given form to the 0/0 or
oo/oo form and use L'Hospital.

Here, note that

   n^(1/n) = e^(ln(n)/n)

and

   ln(n)
   -----
     n

gives you a oo/oo indeterminate form, to which you can apply 
L'Hospital.  You also need to invoke the continuity of the exponential
function e^x, for all x.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
