Hi Oz,

That looks good.  (Of course, A=0 is also a solution regardless of
what x is.)  As for the other, refer to our FAQ at

  Imaginary exponents and Euler's equation.
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.euler.equation.html

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
