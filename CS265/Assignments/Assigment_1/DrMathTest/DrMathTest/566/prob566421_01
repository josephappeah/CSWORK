You can find how to write large numbers here:

  Roman numerals
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.roman.html

But I think you're looking for the wrong number. This year is 2004; 
5004 is not three years from now, but three millennia. Are you 
answering the wrong question, or are you using a different calendar 
than I am?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
