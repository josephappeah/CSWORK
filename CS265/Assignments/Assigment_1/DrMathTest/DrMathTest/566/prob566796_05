Hello again, Rocco --

In a right triangle, the lengths of the sides are related by the 
Pythagorean Theorem which says

  a^2 + b^2 = c^2

where a and b are the lengths of the legs (short sides) and c is the 
length of the hypotenuse (long side).  For example, in a right 
triangle with legs 3 and 4, the hypotenuse is 5, because

  3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2

So we have the base of the triangle 760 feet and the height of the 
triangle about 332.4 feet.  The line representing the height divides 
the triangle into two right triangles.  So if we know where on the 
760-foot side the height is measured, we can find the lengths of the 
other two sides of the triangle.

For example, if the height is measured in the middle of the 760-foot 
side, then each of the two small right triangles has legs 332.4 and 
380 feet (the 380 being half of the 760).  The Pythagorean Theorem 
then tells us that the long sides of those two right triangles (the 
other two sides of the original triangle) have lengths of about 
504.9 feet.

But in order to find the actual lengths of the other two sides using 
this approach, we need to know where on the 760-foot side the height 
is measured.  For example, if the height is measured 200 feet from 
one end of the 760-foot side, then one of the right triangles has 
legs 332.4 and 200 feet while the other has legs 332.4 and 560 feet; 
this case gives us the other two sides of the original triangle as 
about 387.9 feet and 651.2 feet.

And of course any other placement of the height along the 760-foot 
side is going to give us yet different answers for the lengths of 
the other two sides.

The mathematics of all this is fine, but I'm not sure it has any 
practical use, because it seems difficult if not impossible to 
physically determine where on the 760-foot side the height of the 
triangle is measured.
