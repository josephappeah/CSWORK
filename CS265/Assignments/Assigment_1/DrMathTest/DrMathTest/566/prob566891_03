Hello Mary Lou,

You said " if i only have 7 ounces of cleaning solution"  but I think you must
mean 7 oz of bleach.  Is this correct?

Acting on that assumption, we want to find out the amount of water to add so that the 
concentration of bleach to total liquid is the same as 10/(100+10).  The amount of bleach 
is 7 oz, the amount of liquid is w+7, and so the concentration is 7/(w+7).  I set this equal 
to 10/(100+10).  After that it's just algebra.


7/(w+7) = 10/(100+10)

7/(w+7) = 10/110 = 1/11

At this point I multiplied both sides of the equation by 11(w+7), to get rid of the fractions:

77=w+7

I subtracted 7 from both sides:

w=70.
