Hi Deanna,

If you know that the slope is -3, you can write the equation in
slope-intercept form:

  y = -3x + b

If you have the coordinates of a point on the line, then you know
everything except b:

  2 = -3*4 + b
  |    | |
  y    m x

Solve this for b, and you've got the whole equation. 

Does this help?
