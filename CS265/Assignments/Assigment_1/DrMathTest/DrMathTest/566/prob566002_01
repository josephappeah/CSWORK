You square the matrix  = [1  1  0  1]
                         [1  1  0  1]
                         [0  0  1  0]
                         [1  1  0  1]

note that we use Boolean addition, so 1 + 1 = 1

So if you are dealing with a relation on the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, we 
see that 1 is related to 2 and 4 but not 3
         2       "       1  "  4      "  3
         3 is related only to itself
         4 is related to 1 and 2 but not 3
