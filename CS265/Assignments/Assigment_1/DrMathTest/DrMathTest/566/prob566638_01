Hi Raju,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I've never heard of any definition
being applied to raising anything to a power that is a point on an
elliptic curve.  You could create such a definition, certainly, but
then you should check that it has reasonable exponent-like properties.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
