Hi Debbie,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  There are two ways you can proceed.
First, since all the coefficients are even, you can divide by 2 to
get

   x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0   .

Since the coefficient of x is 1, the factorization will look like

   (x +/- ?)(x +/- ?)  .

Since the constant term is negative (-8), that tells you that the two
signs are different, so the factorization must be of the form

   (x + ?)(x - ?)  .

The question marks must be two numbers whose product is 8, so they 
must be 1 and 8, or 2 and 4.  Since the coefficient of x is negative,
that means that the larger factor goes in the (x - ?) term, so the 
possibilities are

     (x + ?)(x - ?)
          1      8
          2      4    .

The other way is to use the Quadratic Formula to find the roots of

   x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0 ,

call them r1 and r2, and then the left side factors as

   (x-r1)(x-r2)

by the Factor Theorem.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
