Hi Nia,

Let's look at something similar, but maybe easier to understand. 
Suppose I ask you

  If you add $5 to the amount of money in my pocket, 
  how much do I have? 

and I also tell you

  The amount of money in my pocket is $7.

Can you answer the first question?  Try it, and tell me how you were
able to do it.
