Hi S.!  You've brought up some interesting questions.  I'll do my 
best to answer them, but let me know if you have any more.

First of all, an integral is typically first introduced as area.  If 
you imagine the graph of x^2, if we want to find the area between 
the graph and the x-axis, we can draw vertical rectangles to 
approximate the area.  By letting the size of the rectangles become 
arbitrarily thin, we obtain what's called the integral.  Since you 
have some familiarity, I'm sure this is all review for you.

In addition to regular functions, f(x)=x^2, we can have what are 
called multivariable functions.  In these, the function value 
depends on more than just x.  For example, f(x,y)=x^2-2y is a 
multivariable function.  Rather than having a xy-plane, we have a 
three dimenionsal xyz graph.

When we speak of a double integral, we integrate with respect to 
more than one variable.  In visual terms, when we integrate with 
respect x and y, we obtain a volume rather than an area.

So, as you can hopefully understand from my explanation, double and 
triple integrals aren't the same as integrating over and over.  
Finally, you mentioned that we cannot differentiate continuously.  
But we can!  The exponential, e^x, is continuously differentiable.
