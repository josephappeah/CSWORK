Hi Kusa,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Yes, there are many different
algorithms for factoring a large number, some of which are better
suited to certain sizes of numbers.  A few of them include the following:

  Trial division
  Pollard Rho
  Pollard p-1 (that's p minus one)
  Elliptic Curve Factoring Method
  Dixon's Algorithm
  Quadratic Sieve
  Number Field Sieve

Trial division is just dividing by all of the primes up to the square
root of the number and is the best algorithm for very small numbers,
but is terrible for large numbers.  Pollard rho and Pollard p-1 are
very nice for fairly small numbers and only a few larger numbers.  The
elliptic curve method is starting to get a little more complicated,
but it works better on numbers a little larger.  Dixon's Algorithm
isn't very efficient, but it will help you to understand the quadratic
sieve.  The quadratic sieve works well for very large numbers, but
it's a little complicated.  It will, however, help you to understand
the number field sieve.  The number field sieve is extremely
complicated, but it is the best known algorithm for the largest
numbers we can factor.

Now search for these on the internet, or look for a book on factoring
to learn the details of all of these algorithms.  Also, I did some
searching a while ago and found several web sites that talk about
various factoring algorithms.

offer further suggestions.
