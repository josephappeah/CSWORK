Hi Elizabeth,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You are confusing differentials and
derivatives.  Derivatives (not differentials) are rates of change.
A differential is an AMOUNT (not a rate) of change, but it is
computed using the tangent line to a given function.

Given y = f(x), suppose you can evaluate f easily at x=a (for example,
while sqrt(x) is generally difficult to calculate by hand, sqrt(64),
[or any perfect square] is easy to compute, and we can use this fact 
to compute approximate values for sqrt(x) when x is near 64, e.g.
sqrt(65) or sqrt(65.5).)  Suppose also that we want to compute
f(x) at a value x which is close to a.  Let Delta_x denote the
difference x-a between a and x (for brevity, I will write it as Dx). 

The actual difference between f(x) and f(a) is f(x)-f(a), which we
often denote Delta_y or Dy:

   Dy = f(x) - f(a)
      = f(a+Dx) - f(a)  .

As the sqrt example shows, this is hard to compute directly by hand.
However, if it is easy to evaluate f(a) and f'(a), then it is easy
to compute the tangent line to y=f(x) at x=a:

   y_tangent = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a) .

If we compute the change in y along the tangent line between the two
points with x-coordinates a and a+Dx, then

   y_tangent - f(a) = f'(a)((a+Dx)-a)
                    = f'(a)Dx  .

We denote the quantity on the left side by dy, and call it the
differential of y at x=a, and it is a function of Dx.  For symmetry 
in notation, we also write dx for Dx, to get the equation

   dy = f'(a)dx .

When dx is small, dy is a good approximation to Dy: that is, the
change in height along the tangent line is very close to the change
in height along the curve itself.

Fro problems 21 and 23, it appears that you are supposed to 
compute the formula for dy in each case, once for the function
y = e^x, and once for y = 10^x.  In the other two problems,
you use this differential to approximate the values.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
