A combinatorial proof is close to an ordinary algebraic proof.

If you have say 8 different objects.

                                       8
You can choose 1 object in 8 ways  =  ---
                                       1

                             8 x 7
You can choose 2 objects in  -----  ways
                             1 x 2

you divide by the number of ways of arranging the objects, since if 
collected as AB this would be the same group as BA.

                             8 x 7 x 6     16 x 7 x 3
You can choose 3 objects in ----------  = -----------
                             1 x 2 x 3      1 x 2 x 3

every alternative selection gives another even term on the top line 
and builds up the powers of 2 in the numerator.  As we show below,  
starting with a power of 2 in the numerator and 1 in the 
denominator, the top line will always be to a higher power of 2 than 
the bottom line and will therefore lead to an even expression.  
Because we started with 2^3 we continue to k = 2^2 = 4 terms, and 
the last term to consider has 4 terms in the numerator.  Collecting 
the powers of 2 on top and bottom lines we get:

      8 x 7 x 6 x 5      2^4 x 7 x 3 x 5
     ---------------  = -----------------
      1 x 2 x 3 x 4       1 x 2^3 x 3

and because the highest power of 2 on the bottom line is at least 
one less than on the top line, we have an even expression.

Although I have used 2^3 as the value of 2^j, the argument is 
completely general and would apply for any value of j.
