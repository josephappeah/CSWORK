I don't  remember formulas for things like this, so I reason them out 
from basic principles.

In this case, a 0.03% solution means that 1 ml of solution contains 
0.03/100 = 0.0003 ml of solute (if it's 3% by volume). The 30 ml you 
want to make will have 30 times as much solute, or 30 * 0.0003 ml = 
0.009 ml.

How much of the 3% solution do you need to get 0.009 ml of solute? 
Each milliliter of 3% solution contains 3/100 = 0.03 ml of solute. 
That's more than you need; you'll less than one milliliter of 
solution. Specifically, you'll need

  0.009 ml / 0.03 ml = 9/30 = 0.3 ml of 3% solution

The other 29.7 ml will be water (or whatever the solvent is).
