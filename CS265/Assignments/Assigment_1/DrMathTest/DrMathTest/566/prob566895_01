Hi, Luma --

Obviously, we can't develop a valid mathematical proof the 2 = 3.  
But we can "prove" things like that if we use invalid mathematical 
methods.  Take a look at the information on the following page in 
the Dr. Math FAQs and see if it answers your question:

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.false.proof.html

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
