Hi,

Recall that the single digit divisor could only be 3 or 7. They are
both relatively prime to 10. So, if we start with 21, the next
multiple of 3 which will also end in '1' is 21 + 30, because 30 is the
least common multiple of 3 and 10. Let's add 3. 22 + 3 = 25. 25
doesn't end in 2. 25 + 3 = 28. 28 doesn't end in 2. 28 + 3 = 31. 31
doesn't end in 2. We could have to continue in this fashion until we
get to 52 = 22 + 30. 

Recall, from the problem, we wanted the number to end in 2, not 5 or 1
or some other digit. It's in the problem statement. Further, we wanted
the number to be 1 more than a multiple of the one digit divisor. If 3
is the one digit divisor, 22 meets both criteria. It is 1 more than a
multiple of 3, and it ends in 2.
