Hi Martin,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Your original problem had two
initial conditions:

Since the conditions are specified for x=-1, you need to use the 
function ln(|x|) in your solution instead of ln(x), which is not
defined for x < 0.  Substitute x = -1 into your general solution

>    y = x^(-1)(A + B * ln(|x|))

and its derivative y' and solve for A and B.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
