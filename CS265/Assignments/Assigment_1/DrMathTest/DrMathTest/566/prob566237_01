Hi Danna,

The basic idea is that the shape the hanging rope will make is called
a 'catenary', which is very nearly a parabola.  Here's another way to
think about the same problem:

  Suppose you draw a parabola that opens downward, and crosses 
  the x-axis at x=a and x=-a.  The vertex of the parabola is 15 
  above the x-axis, at the point (0,15).  You know that the 
  length of the part of the parabola above the x-axis is 30 feet.
  What is the value of a?  

To figure this out, you need to be able to compute the arc length of a
section of a parabola.  Presumably, whoever asked you to solve this
problem believes that you're supposed to be able to do that. 

Is this enough to get started?
