Hi Anne.

If your ping-pong balls have diameters of 40 mm, then the radius is
20 mm = 2 cm.  Then the volume is 4*pi*(2cm)^3/3 = 33.5 cm^3, not
3.35 cm^3.

But as to the overall question itself, I am confused too.  I think 
it is because you have not stated the question precisely enough for
me to help.  We were able to get past "area in a 3D Hexagon" once 
it became clear you were talking about a hexagonal prism.  Then you 
asked about the number of spheres (ping-pong balls) that can fit in
this object.  This is in general a HARD problem, and it can take a
lot of geometric and arithmetic work to find the answer and prove 
it.  This is why I sent you to other websites to learn about "sphere
packing", because the material there ought to give you a headstart.

Then the phrase "spherical cap" caused some trouble, because while
I know what such a shape is, it seems unlikely that you want it as
part of your solution (to the ping-pong ball problem).  Now you have
used the phrase "hexagonal sphere", and I confess that I don't have
any idea what this is.  

Maybe we should start over?  I suggested that you might wish to 
tell me the original website where you found this problem--can you
do that?
