Hi Patrick,

It's clear that d divides the difference 3x, and that it divides
x+y+2z, right?  Now consider the congruences

  x + y + 2z = 0 (mod d)
  x^2 + y^2 - xy = z^2 (mod d)

and show that

  3(x + z)^2 = 0 (mod d).

This is certainly true if d=1 or d=3.  If d is anything else, then
there is some prime number p dividing d such that

  x = 0 (mod p)
  x = -z (mod p).

This is easy to show except for the possibility p=3, but if d is
divisible by 3 but not equal to 3, then you can still get the same
results by picking a prime p which divides d/3.  Show that this
implies that your triple is not primitive.
