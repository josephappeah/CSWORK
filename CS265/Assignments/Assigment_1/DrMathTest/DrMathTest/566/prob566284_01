Hi Asif,

It gives greater leverage, i.e., you can generate the same total
amount of torque by applying a small force at a long distance, or a
large force at a short distance.  People are only good at applying
small forces, so we use wrench handles (and other kinds of lever arms)
to increase the distance over which we can act.  

Does this help?
