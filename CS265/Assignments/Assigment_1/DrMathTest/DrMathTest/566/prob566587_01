Hello Arvin,

I don't know the answer to your specific question -- I have never
seen a name for such things.

There are so-called "regular polyhedra" where all the faces are
regular polygons and they all meet at the same angles at all the
vertices.  There are only five of these: the tetrahedron, the cube,
the octahedron, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron, having
4, 6, 8, 12 and 20 faces, respectively.
