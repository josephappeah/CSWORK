I think you are using "^" to mean "squared"; we use a slightly 
different convention borrowed from some programming languages, 
that "^" indicates that the next value is an exponent. So I'll write 
the problem as

          1 - x^2
   ---------------------- =
   (1 + xy)^2 - (x + y)^2

          (1 + x)(1 - x)
   --------------------------------
   (1 + xy + x + y)(1 + xy - x - y)

Try factoring the factors of the denominator by grouping. For 
example,

  1 + a + b + ab = (1 + a) + b(1 + a)

                 = (1 + b)(1 + a)

Another trick worth keeping in mind: when you hope to cancel 
factors, try those factors you wish were present, to see if in fact 
they are. In this case, you would try (1 + x) and (1 - x) as factors 
of (1 + xy + x + y) or (1 + xy - x - y). Trying a specific factor is 
a lot easier than randomly looking for any factor.
