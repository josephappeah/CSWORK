Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

An odd number is a number which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided
by 2. An even number is a number which leaves a remainder of 0 when
divided by 2. 0 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, so it is even.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
