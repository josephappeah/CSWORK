Hi Mitropam,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  First you should check

    lim     n^(1/n)  =  1.
  n -> inf

Then you can verify that each of the terms in the sequence is, in
fact, bounded.  (In fact, the largest term is 3^(1/3), and the
sequence descreases monotonically after that.)

Using those two facts together, you can show that the limit is 1.  The
idea is that you are adding up n different things, most of which are
very close to 1, so you will get something very close to n, and then
you divide by n and get something very close to 1.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
