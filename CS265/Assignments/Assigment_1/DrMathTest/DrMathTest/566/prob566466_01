Hi Christine,

'Due' north just means 'exactly north', without any deviation.

      X
      |
  2km |
      |
      Y--------Z
         ? km

The angle XYZ is a right angle.

Right, the angle YXZ is 35°12'.

Once you have the diagram right, you're almost done.  The tangent of
angle YXZ is 

  tan(YXZ) = opposite / adjacent

           = YZ / XY

           = ? / 2000 m

Given the angle, you can look up the tangent; and then you have two
values out of three, so you can solve for the length of YZ. 

Can you take it from here?
