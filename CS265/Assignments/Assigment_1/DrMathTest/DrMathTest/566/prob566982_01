Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Man!

Recall that the sum of the measures of the four internal angles of
any quadrilateral is 360 degrees.

Let the measure of <BYD be x, the measure of <YBA be y, and the
measure of <DYB be z.  Then from quadrilateral ABYD, you can see
that

   x + y + z + 120 = 360.

Furthermore, from the fact that DY and BY are angle bisectors, and
using quadrilateral ABCD, you know that

   2*x + 2*y + 50 + 120 = 360.

Eliminating x + y from these two equations will allow you to find
z, which is the answer you want.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
