Hello, Raman --

(1) Most mathematicians will say that the slope of a vertical line 
is undefined -- not that it is equal to infinity.

(2) The feature of perpendicular lines that the product of the 
slopes is equal to -1 does not apply in the case where the lines are 
vertical and horizontal.

Even if you do consider the slope of a vertical line to be equal to 
infinity, you can't say anything like "0 times infinity equals -1", 
because multiplication is only defined for numbers, and "infinity" 
is not a number.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
