Hi Tony,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You want:

                    2
  area = pi * radius

or A equals pi r squared.  For any other geometric formulas you need,
refer to:

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
