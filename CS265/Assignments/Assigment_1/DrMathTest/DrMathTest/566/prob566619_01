Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

There are a couple problems with your method. THe first is that the
probability of having a boy is _always_ 1/2. It doesn't matter if it
is first, second, third, or fourth.

The probability that the first child is a boy is 1/2. The probability
the second child is a boy is 1/2. The probability the third child is a
boy is 1/2, and the probability the fourth child is a boy is 1/2. You
have to consider the _combination_ of the children, not just each
child in turn.

One mistake was to neglect the fact that exactly 2 of the children
were boys.

There are a couple ways to solve this problem:

1) Count all the possibilities. There are 16 ways the sexes of the 4
children can be arranged:

    BBBB
    BBBG
    BBGB
    BGBB
    BBGG
    BGBG
    BGGB
    BGGG
    GBBB
    GBBG
    GBGB
    GBGG
    GGBB
    GGBG
    GGGB
    GGGG

Of these 16 ways, 6 ways have exactly 2 boys. 6/16 = 3/8.

2) Using the formula:

    C(n,r)*(1/2)^r * (1 - 1/2)^(n-r)

  = C(n,r)*(1/2)^n

In this case n = 4 and r = 2:

    C(4,2)*(1/2)^4

  = 6     * 1/16

  = 6/16
  = 3/8

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
