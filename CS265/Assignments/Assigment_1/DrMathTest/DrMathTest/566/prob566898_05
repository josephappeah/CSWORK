To find the number of combinations of pairs of letters taken from 5 
different letters A to E (with repeats allowed) you require the 
coefficient of x^2 in the expansion of

  (1+x+x^2)^5

 =  1 + 5x + 15x^2 + 30x^3 + 45x^4 + 51x^5 + 45x^6 + 30x^7 + ... 

and the coefficient of x^2 is 15 showing that there are 15 such 
combinations.

If I had 3 letters A,B,C the generating function is

  (1+x+x^2)^3

  =  1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 7x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6

and this time the coefficient of x^2 is 6 so there are 6 
combinations if just 3 letters are available.

If we have 4 letters available the generating function is

   (1+x+x^2)^4

 = 1 + 4x + 10x^2 + 16x^3 + 19x^4 + 16x^5 + 10x^6 + 4x^7 + x^8

and the coefficient of x^2 is 10.  So there are 10 combinations of 2 
letters if 4 letters are available.

The algebra can be a little tedious, but I use Maple which performs 
the algebra for me so I am able to give the answers very quickly.
