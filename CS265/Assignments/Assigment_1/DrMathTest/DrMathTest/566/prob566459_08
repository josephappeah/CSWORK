>Is SQUARE ROOT OF ZERO AND CUBEROOT OF ZERO defined r undefined

Hi Vijay,

The cube root of a number A is defined if there is some number B such
that 

  B * B * B = A

Is there some number B such that

  B * B * B = 0?

If so, then that number is the cube root of B.  Square roots work the
same way.
