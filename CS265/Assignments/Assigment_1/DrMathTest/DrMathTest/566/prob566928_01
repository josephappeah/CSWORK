Hi Shalini,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Try using induction on n instead of
induction on r.  That is, assume it is true for n=k, and prove it for
n=k+1.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
