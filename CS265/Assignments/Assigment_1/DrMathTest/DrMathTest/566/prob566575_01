People do disagree on this, as discussed here:

  Order of Operations Dispute
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57025.html

The question is, what authority do you cite for your exception? I 
have seen some texts state the rules your way, and others not mention 
such an extra rule but still act like it was there. Which way to go 
depends on the text for the class you are taking or teaching.

My preference is to do what real mathematicians do, and just never 
write such an ambiguous expression.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
