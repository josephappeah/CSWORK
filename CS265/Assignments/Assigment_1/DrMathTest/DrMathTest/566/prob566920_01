Hi, Lauryn --

Given a set of n points on a line, each distinct choice of two of 
those points determines exactly one line segment; and every possible 
line segment is determined by some choice of two of thos points.  So 
the number of line segments which can be determined by n points on a 
line is the number of ways of choosing 2 out of n objects.

Perhaps you have worked other problems involving the concept of "m 
choose n".  If not, you can get some basic information on the 
concept by looking in the Dr. Math FAQs under the topic 
of "permutations and combinations".

For your particular problem, the number of ways of choosing 2 out of 
n objects is

  n(n-1)
  ------ = (n^2-n)/2
   2*1

Note that this function is indeed quadratic (or, as you called 
it, "parabolic") -- as you guessed it might be.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
