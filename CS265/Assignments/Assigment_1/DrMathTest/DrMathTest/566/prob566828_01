Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

You cannot factor this quadratic polynomial. You are going to have to
solve it using the quadratic formula. Alternatively, if you have
multiple possible answers, you can substitute them for x to see if
they satisfy the equation.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
