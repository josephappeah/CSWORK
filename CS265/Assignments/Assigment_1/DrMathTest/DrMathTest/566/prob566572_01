Hi Alisha,

Ideally, he'd help you understand the theorems so well that you could
prove them yourself, whenever you want to.  Then you wouldn't have to
memorize anything.

Can you give me an example of what you're talking about? 

>i think that it is hard to memorize all the theorems and postulates

Not only is it too hard; but it almost guarantees that you'll forget
them as soon as the course is over.  And it pretty much misses the
whole point of a geometry course, which is to teach you how to
_invent_ proofs.  You don't do that through memorization.
