Hi, Michael --

The instructions are not clear, so I'm not sure what is expected.

You converted the 4/50 to the decimal .08 and then wrote that 
decimal using a power of 10 as 8x10^-2.

With the way the instructions are written, I think you are supposed 
to somehow use a power of 10 before converting anything to a 
decimal.  The way to do that would be

  4/50 = 8/100 = 8x10^-2

In other words, we first express the given fraction as an equivalent 
fraction which has a denominator which is a power of 10.

But that is only a guess as to what they wanted you to do with 
this....
