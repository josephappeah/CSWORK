Suppose the shirts are AA, BB, CC and DD.  We require the number of 
arrangements such that AA or BB etc, does not occur. 

The number of unrestricted arrangements is 8!/[2!2!2!2!] = 2520

You need to use the inclusion-exclusion principle here.

The number of ways with the A shirts together (regardless of what 
the others are doing) is found by joining the two A's as a single 
unit and considering in how many ways they can be together.  There 
are 7 objects to permute and this gives 7!/[2!2!2!] as number of 
ways they are together. 

So number of ways the A's are together is  7!/[2!2!2!]  and of 
course the same would apply if B's, C's or D's are together giving C
(4,1) x 7!/[2!2!2!] as the number of ways that 1 pair is together.

For two pairs together a similar calc. gives  C(4,2) x 6!/[2!2!]

For three pairs together the answer is  C(4,3) x 5!/[2!]

For four pairs together the answer is  C(4,4) x 4!

We now use the inclusion-exclusion formula for the number of ways 
that one or more pairs are together  

n(A or B or C or D) =   C(4,1) x 7!/[2!2!2!]
                      - C(4,2) x 6!/[2!2!]
                      + C(4,3) x 5!/[2!]
                      - C(4,4) x 4!

                    =  2520 - 1080 + 240 - 24

                    =  1656

This is the number of ways that one or more pairs are together.  The 
number of ways such that none are together is then

     2520 - 1656 =  864

There are 864 ways in which no pairs are together.
