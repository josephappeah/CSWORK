Did you look at our FAQ on the subject?

  Roman numerals
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.roman.html

The Romans themselves knew nothing of billions. They also did not 
have a multiplicative system, where MM would mean 1000 times 1000; 
rather the system was additive, so that MM would mean 
1000+1000=2000, and with a bar over the first M it would be 
1,000,000+1000=1,001,000. So your ideas are not valid -- though in 
fact there was a period when Roman numerals were used very loosely 
and some people experimented with multiplicative versions.

The best answer I know is to use the bar twice, multiplying M by 
1000 and then by 1000 again:
  _
  _
  M = 1000*1000*1000 = 1 billion

But whatever you use, it is a modern extension of the Roman numeral 
system.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
