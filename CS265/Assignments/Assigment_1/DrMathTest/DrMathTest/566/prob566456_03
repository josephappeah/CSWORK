Hi Shanda,

What I'm trying to find out is whether you understand least common
multiples yourself, and just don't feel that you know how to explain
them to someone else; or whether you don't really understand them
yourself. 

If you don't understand them yourself, let me know, and we can talk
about that.  If you do understand them, then tell me what you know
about them in your own words, and I'll help you turn that into a
better explanation.
