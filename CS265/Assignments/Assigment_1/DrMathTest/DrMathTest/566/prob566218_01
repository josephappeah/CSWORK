You can find help in working with signed numbers here:

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/sets/select/dm_pos_neg.html

Your first sample expression is meaningless; you can't have "(-)", 
since the "-" has nothing to operate on.

The second is a product of three numbers, one of which is negative; 
the simple rule is that in such a case, if there are an odd number 
of negative factors, the product is negative.

The third is a quotient of two numbers, and again since there are an 
EVEN number of negatives, the product is POSITIVE.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
