You're right, you need a pattern.  But the pattern can start at any
point, just as a repeating decimal can start anywhere:

                     _
  1.2222...      = 1.2
                      _
  1.2333...      = 1.23
                        __
  1.234565656... = 1.23456

So you could write the union as

  A u B = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, ...}

And since sets are by definition unordered, you could write it

  A u B = {3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}

Or you could use a more explicit notation, e.g., 

  A u B = {x: x > 1 and (x < 8 or x is even)}

For what it's worth, you don't really have to have a 'pattern' to have
an infinite set, so long as the set is clearly described.  For
example, there is no 'pattern' to the set of prime numbers, but we've
all agreed on what that set contains, so we don't worry about it. 

Does this help?
