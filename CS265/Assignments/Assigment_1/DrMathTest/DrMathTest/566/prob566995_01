Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The definition of continuity implies that

  lim    f(g(x))  = f( lim   g(x) )
 x -> h               x -> h

as long as f is *continuous* at the limit point (that is, the result
of the limit inside the f on the right side of the equation I wrote
here), which also requires that the limit point not be infinity.  The
square root function is continuous at every POSITIVE point, so you can
pull the square root out of the limit as long as the limit that you
end up with inside the square root is a POSITIVE number.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
