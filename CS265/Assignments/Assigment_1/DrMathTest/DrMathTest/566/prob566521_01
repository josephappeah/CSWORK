Hi Aileen,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

You're guess is right on.  If sales tax are 8.5% then the tax on a 
$374 item would be:

  $347 x 0.085 = $29.495

So the total cost after tax would be:

  $347 + $29.50 = $376.50

(I rounded up because most places round up their sales tax if it 
comes to a fraction of a cent.)

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
