Let's not jump ahead.  If you try to do too many steps at once, then I
have to guess where you're getting off track.  Can you try answering
the question I asked you last time? 

  If you were at the point (5,3), and you needed to move to 
  the point (1,4), how far would you have to move in the x
  direction?  (Moving to the right is positive; moving to
  the left is negative.)  How about in the y direction?  
  (Up is positive, down is negative.)

Just answer that, and then we can go to the next step, okay?
