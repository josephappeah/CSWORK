Hi Sherica,

You don't 'find' that so much as remember it.  I always start from the
old saying that 

  A pint is a pound, the world around.

Since I know a pound is 16 ounces (of weight), I know that a pint is
16 ounces (of volume).  

For the most part, the units are based on doubling:

  There are 2 cups (8 oz) in a pint (16 oz).
  There are 2 pints in a quart (32 oz).  
  There are 4 quarts in a gallon (128 oz).

Does this help?
