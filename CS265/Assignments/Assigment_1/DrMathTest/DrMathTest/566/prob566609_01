I have never heard the term "process signs" and I cannot find it on 
the Web. The signs you list are often called "operators". Perhaps 
your textbook or your teacher uses the term "process signs" instead, 
but you'd have to ask your teacher or look in the glossary of your 
textbook, because the term is not in general use as far as I can tell.
