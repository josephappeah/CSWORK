Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Ok, you're trying to prove:

  ((~P ^ ~V) -> ~T)

Here is how the proof starts (start with what you are given)

1) (P v Q)                     given
2) (Q -> R)                    given
3) (R -> (S -> ~T))            given
4) ((~S -> U) ^ (U -> V))     given

The main connective in the sentence you are trying to prove is ->

For an explanation of what I mean by "main connective", check out:

  Main Connectives in a Proof
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55623.html

The most straight-forward way to prove a sentence whose main 
connective is -> is to assume the first part and then derrive the 
second part.  So we want to assume

  (~P ^ ~V)

and derrive:

  ~T

Ok, so now our proof looks like this:

1) (P v Q)                     given
2) (Q -> R)                    given
3) (R -> (S -> ~T))            given
4) ((~S -> U) ^ (U -> V))     given
5)    (~P ^ ~V)                Assumption

The key rule in logic that you need to solve this proof 
is "disjunctive syllogism".  The rule says the following:

Given:

  (X v Y)

and

  ~X

you can conclude:

  Y

Seems simple enough.  We know from (X v Y) that either X or Y is 
true.  We know from ~X that X is not true.  Therefore, the only thing 
that is possible is that Y is true.

Let's do a little more work on your proof (most of this you already 
did)

1)  (P v Q)                     given
2)  (Q -> R)                    given
3)  (R -> (S -> ~T))            given
4)  ((~S -> U) ^ (U -> V))     given
5)     (~P ^ ~V)                Assumption
6)     (~Q v R)                 from line 2
7)     (~R v (~S v ~T))         from line 3
8)     (~S -> U)                from line 4 (simplification)
9)     (S v U)                  from line 8
10)    (U -> V)                 from line 4 (simplification)
11)    (~U v V)                 from line 10
12)    ~P                       from line 5 (simplification)
13)    ~V                       from line 5 (simplification)

Ok, now if you look at line 12, you'll see that we have ~P.  If you 
put that together with line 1, you can conclude Q must be true by 
disjunctive syllogism.

Now that we know Q is true, if we look at line 6, we can use 
disjunctive syllogism again to conclue that R must be true.

Also, you can look at line 13 and see that V is false.  If you take 
that with line 11, you can use disjunctive syllogism to show that ~U 
is true (i.e. U is false).

Keep working through all of the sentences like that until you get 
~T.  At that point we will have done everything we need to.  
Specifically, we assumed (~P ^ ~V) and derrived ~T.  Therefore we can 
conclude that ((~P ^ ~V) -> ~T) is true.

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
