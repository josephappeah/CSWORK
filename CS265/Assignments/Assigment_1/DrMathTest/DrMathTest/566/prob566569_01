Hi Kate.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  Imagine unwrapping the
cylinder.  A triangle will wrap neatly around the cylinder, with
the hypotenuse going four times around if.... what?

                 +
        S     .  |
          .      | 16 inches
      .          |
   +=============+

   4*circumference

The length of the stripe is S, and it is the hypotenuse of the
right triangle above.  Can you finish from here?
