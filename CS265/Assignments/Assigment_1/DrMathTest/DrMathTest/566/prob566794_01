Hello --

This problem is equivalent to a classic problem commonly known 
as "the knights of the round table".  There are several pages in the 
Dr. Math archives related to this problem.  Here is a link to one of 
them which contains several different discussions of the problem:

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55862.html

You can also search the archives yourself ("knights" is a good 
keyword to use) to find further information on the problem.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
