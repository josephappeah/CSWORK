Hi Charlie.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

It's not clear what type of tournament you're trying to run.
Is it a round robin?  Or a modified (so that some teams get to
play a minimum of 3 games) double-elimination?  Or something
else?  If a round-robin (which is ideal--every team plays every
other team exactly once) isn't possible, what is the constraint?
