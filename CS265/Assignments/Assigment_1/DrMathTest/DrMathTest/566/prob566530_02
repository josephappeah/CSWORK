Hi Katherine, 

Here's a hint.  Exponentials and logs are inverses of each other.  
That is, they "undo" one another.

If I have 
  
  log_10 (x) = y

I would take 10 to the power of both sides of the equations.  That is,

       log_10 (x) = y

  10^[log_10 (x)] = 10^y

                x = 10^y

As you can see, using an exponential "gets rid of" the log in the 
same way that multiplying by a common denominator would "get rid of" 
a fraction.

Does that help?  If you still have questions, let me know!
