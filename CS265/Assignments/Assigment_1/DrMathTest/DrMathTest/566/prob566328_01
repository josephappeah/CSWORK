Hi Echo,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

You've got the first couple steps right, but you seem to lose track 
of one of your numbers:

  f(4) = 4 = k(4^2) - 4

  4 = k(16) - 4

Next we add 4 to both sides of the equation:

  8 = 16k

Now divide both sides of the equation by 16 and you will know what k 
is.

Once you know what k is, you can change the definition of f(x):

  f(x) = kx^2 - 4

You can change "k" to the value you found for k.

Once you have done that, you should be able to solve f(x) for any x.

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
