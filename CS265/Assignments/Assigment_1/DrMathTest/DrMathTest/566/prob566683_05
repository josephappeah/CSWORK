Hi John,

The issue isn't whether she can _do_ basic arithmetic.  It's whether
she can _explain_ basic arithmetic.  For example, maybe she can solve
a problem like

  412
 - 86
 ----
  326

by blindly following the algorithm she's been given.  But when she
gets done, does she understand the relationship among all these
numbers?  In particular, does she understand that 326 is the number
she would have to _add_ to 86 to get 412?   

If she does, then she can understand that 

  412 - 86 = 326

is the same thing as

  412 = 86 + 326

And if she can understand that, then she can understand that

  -7 - 3 = ?

is the same thing as 

  -7 = 3 + ?

That is, the result of the operation

  -7 - 3

is whatever I would have to add to 3 to get to -7.  And what would
that be?  If I add -3, I get down to zero:

  -7 = 3 + (-3 + ?)

And to get from zero to anything, I just add the thing:

  -7 = 3 + (-3 + -7)

     = 3 + -10

There are two things to keep in mind about all this.  The first is
that it's much better for her to work through a slow, tedious, even
silly-looking procedure (like the one I just used) that she
understands, than for her to try to follow a 'better' procedure that
she doesn't understand.  

The second is that the way you can tell if she understands arithmetic
isn't to give her problems and see if she can work them, but to see if
she can _explain_ to you what she's doing as she works them, and why.
 If she's just able to say what steps she's doing (e.g., "And next, I
make the 4 smaller and borrow a 1 to put over the 1"), but not why
they work, then she's not ready to move on.
