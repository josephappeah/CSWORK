Hi Patrick,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  First of all, not all integer
solutions can be writtin in that form.  For example, (0, 2, 2) cannot.
 So perhaps you mean:  Show that they generate all *primitive*
solutions, meaning all integer solutions are an integer multiple of
one of those.  So let's assume that gcd(x, y) = 1.

The trick is not to write p and q in terms of x and y, but rather to
find simple expressions for p and q in terms of x, y, and z.  To do
this, you should think of p^2, q^2, and pq as three variables, and
solve for them in terms of x, y, and z.

For example,

  x = q^2 - p^2
  y = 2pq - p^2
  z = p^2 + q^2 - pq

so

  z - x = 2p^2 - pq
  y + 2z - 2x = 3p^2.

That's pretty good!  And for q:

  2z + y = 2q^2 + p^2
  x + 2z + y = 3q^2,

and we can also get pq:

  2y + z - x = 3pq.

So first we need to prove that if (x, y, z) are integers and

  x^2 - xy + y^2 = z^2,

then

  y + 2z + x   and   y + 2z - 2x   and   2y + z - x

are all divisible by 3.  Can you do that?  It's basically an exercise
in modular arithmetic.  Look at the equation mod 3.  And the other two
basically come for free when you have any one of the three.

Then we expect that

  (3p^2)*(3q^2) = (3pq)^2,

so let's write that in terms of x, y, and z:

  (y + 2z + x)(y + 2z - 2x) = (2y + z - x)^2, and therefore

  [(y + 2z + x)/3][(y + 2z - 2x)/3] = [(2y + z - x)/3]^2.

Can you prove that this is true for any solution of your equation?

Next, you should verify that p^2 and q^2 are relatively prime by
taking the gcd of

  (y + 2z + x)/3  and  (y + 2z - 2x)/3.

Then you use the theorem that says that if r and s are two integers,
relatively prime, and r*s is a square, then r and s are each squares.
 The rest falls right out.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
