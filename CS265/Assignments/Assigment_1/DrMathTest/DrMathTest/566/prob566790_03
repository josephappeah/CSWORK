Hi Tom.

You are right to identify the root of the problem as one of 
definition--it comes down to exactly what you mean by smooth.
Mathematicians have given the word "smooth" a technical meaning,
and this may or may not be what you want for a particular 
application--the use of exponentials such as e^-[P(x)] might be
useful for analytical work (because taking derivatives is a bit
easier), but be totally inappropriate for a computer graphics 
program (which needs to perform numerical evaluations as fast as
possible).

Other choices might involve a maximum value of some set of 
low-order derivatives (I think this is what you meant by referring
to velocity and acceleration earlier).  For example if you allowed
f(x)=x between x in [-1,1], you would have kept the velocity minimum
(since |df/dx| <= 1, but without any sort of constraint on the
acceleration (which in fact doesn't exist at x=-1 and +1.).  I 
believe that a sine wave will perform similarly--you can use

  f(x) = sin(pi*x/2)

as your bridging function--certainly f(1) = 1, and f'(1) = 0,
but f''(1-) = -pi^2/4, and you can see that higher derivatives are
all going to fail to exist at the endpoints. 

Regarding your thoughts about "energy", there is a way to 
quantify this--it involves computing the power spectrum of the
function f(x) using the Fourier Transform.  You can try to find
functions that have power only at "low" frequencies, or minimize 
the amount of power in bins above a certain frequency, etc.
