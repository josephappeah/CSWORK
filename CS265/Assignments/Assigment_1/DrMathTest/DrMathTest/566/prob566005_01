Hi Trevor,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You are apparently only looking at
the 500-4x formula.  However, you should note the units.  500-4x is
the yield PER TREE at tree density x (trees per hectare).  What you
are supposed to maximize is the yield PER HECTARE, not PER TREE.

Can you find a formula for the kg of peaches per hectare when there
are x trees per hectare, each yielding (500-4x) kg of peaches per
tree?  That is the quantity you need to maximize.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
