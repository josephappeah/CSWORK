Hi Alyssa,

Bases are all about grouping, and for humans, with 10 fingers, the
most natural group size to use is 10.  Imagine counting some items
using your fingers.  You could get up to 10, and then you'd want to
use something like a pebble or a stick to represent those 10 items, so
you could use your fingers again.  

Does that make sense?
