The statement sounds a little extreme. Can you qualify it a little? 
Did she say what algorithms ARE taught elsewhere? Did she specify 
which algorithms (for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or 
division? which ones in particular?) she is referring to. More than 
one algorithm is taught in some cases within America. What we the 
point of this comment -- to tell you what algorithms you should be 
teaching, or to point out some ways in which the algorithms you 
teach are bad, or perhaps just to make it clear that there are other 
ways to do things (which is a valid point to make)? And what did you 
find out from your friends?

I may be able to research this a little, but that background will 
help me know what I'm really looking for. It might be useful to ask 
for documentation of the claim -- she might benefit from doing some 
research of her own, and may have better access to such information 
than you and I do.
