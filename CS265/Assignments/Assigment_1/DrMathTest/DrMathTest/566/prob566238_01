That's exactly right. You know the two legs of the right triangle, 
with the right angle between them, and the distance you seek is the 
length of the hypotenuse.

The bearing is the hard part. For that you need trigonometry, so I 
assume you are in a trig class. Can you find the angles of the right 
triangle? If you're not sure, check out this page in the Dr. Math

Then, if you draw the diagram, you should be able to figure out which 
two angles to add to get the final bearing. If you need more help, 
write back and show all the work you are able to do.
