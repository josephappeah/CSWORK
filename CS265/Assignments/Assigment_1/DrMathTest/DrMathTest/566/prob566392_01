Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Let's use variables to represent our unknowns:

    G = # of girls in class
    B = # of boys in class

There are a total of 26 students, or:

    G + B = 26

Each girl draws a triangle, so each girl contributes 3 sides to the
total: 3G. Each boy draws a rectangle, so each boy contributes 4 sides
to the total: 4B:

   3G + 4B = 92

Now, we have two equations to solve for our unknowns:

       G + B = 26
     3G + 4B = 92

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
