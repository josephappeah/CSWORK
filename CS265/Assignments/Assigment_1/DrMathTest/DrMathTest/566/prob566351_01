Hi Martha,

The 3,4,5 triangle is special in that one of the angles is 90
degrees (since 5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2). This means that you can treat
the 3 as the base and 4 as the height (which is perpendicular
to the base because of that 90 degree angle). This means the
area is

   A = (1/2) base x height = (1/2) * 3 * 4 = 6

In general, if you didn't recognize the right angle, there is
a general formula to calculate the area of any triangle
given three sides a,b,c.

  A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))

The s is called the semi-perimeter and it's just s=(a+b+c)/2.

You may read more about this formula here:

I hope this helped!
