Tina,
You've got the problem set up exactly.  All that's left is to solve
for x.  It looks like you'll get an equation that's quadratic in x,
but the x^2 will actually cancel out.  I'll work through some of it, here:

 sqrt((x - 10)^2 + (0 - 4)^2) = sqrt((x - 6)^2 + (0 - 2)^2)

First, square both sides to get rid of the square roots:

 (x - 10)^2 + (0 - 4)^2 = (x - 6)^2 + (0 - 2)^2

Then, expand everything in the parentheses:

 x^2 - 20x + 100 + 16 = x^2 - 12x + 36 + 4

Cancel the x^2 on both sides and collect like terms:

 -20x + 116 = -12x + 40

From here, you're just solving a linear equation.  If you're still not
convinced that x = 19/2 is a solution, just plug it in.  You'll see
that it makes the equation true.

Let me know if you have any more questions.
