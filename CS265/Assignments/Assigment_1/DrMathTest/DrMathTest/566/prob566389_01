Hi Hadley,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

To find the mean, add all the numbers up and divide by the number of 
data points.

You have 8 data points, so add the numbers up and divide by 8.

You can find out more about means here:

  Mean, Median, Mode, Range

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
