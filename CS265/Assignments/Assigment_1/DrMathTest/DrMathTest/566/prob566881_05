Try searching at Google for the following sets of keywords

  - Godel

  - string art

  - fractals

  - art perspective

and you should find a ton of information on some of the ways in which
math is related to art.

They may not have spent much time thinking about it, but if you can
get some of them to articulate what they feel about it, you'd be doing
everyone a big service.  As it is, we mostly have to guess; and as you
probably know from experience, adults aren't all that great at
guessing what kids are thinking.  :^D

But in your country, kids aren't used to just having things handed to
them either, are they?  They're still being raised to believe that the
way to be successful is to work hard and be productive.  

Unfortunately, in America, more and more the way to be successful is
to find a way to take things away from people who are working hard and
being productive.  To do that, it's more useful to study things like
law than to study things like science.

In other countries, people are still trying to figure out how to
become more productive, so they can increase their wealth.  In
America, we seem to be more concerned with trying to spend the wealth
we already have.  In the long run, I think your system will be more
beneficial to your country than our current system will be to ours. 

When you find the schools in your country emphasizing things like
cooking and weight lifting instead of science and math, you'll know
you're on the way down instead of the way up. 

>Anyway, I hope you can help me figure out what I should do. 
>Thank you for reading my email.

You're very welcome.  I'm glad I could help, and I enjoyed hearing
your perspective on things.
