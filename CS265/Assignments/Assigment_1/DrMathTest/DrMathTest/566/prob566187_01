Hello Fotis,

If you draw a picture of the result you desire, call the centers of
the circles O1 and O2, the points of tangency R1 and R2, and call P
the point where the common internal tangent intersects the
line connecting O1 and O2.

It's easy to show that the triangles O1 R1 P and O2 R2 P are
similar.  That means that O1 P and O2 P are in the same ratio
as the ratio of the radii of the two circles.

Is that enough of a hint?
