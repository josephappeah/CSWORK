Hi Ryan,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The general method for converting
z = a+bi to polar form is to let r = sqrt(a^2+b^2), and then write

          a     b
  z = r [ - + i - ] .
          r     r    

Note that (a/r)^2 + (b/r)^2 = 1.  For every such pair of numbers,
there is a unique angle x such that

   cos(x) = a/r   and  sin(x) = y/r.

Also note that this means that

   tan(x) = y/x ,

but x must be chosen in the proper quadrant to make the sin and cos
equations valid.  

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
