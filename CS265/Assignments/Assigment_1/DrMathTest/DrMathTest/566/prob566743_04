Hello again --

Thanks for the notes of appreciation....

Different people learn different ways.  The method I showed you for 
solving this problem -- using a number line -- doesn't work for some 
people.  The method you describe for finding a solution is great for 
people who work better with symbols (i.e., the numbers themselves) 
rather than pictures or diagrams (i.e., in this case, the number 
line).

I'm not sure exactly how you told your son to go about using your 
method.  He might start with

  13-2 = 11  13+2 = 15
  14-3 = 11  14+3 = 17
  15-4 = 11  15+4 = 19
  ...

He might continue this way all the way up to

  ...
  25-14 = 11  25+14 = 39

Or, using your idea about patterns, he might notice that each time 
he goes from one possibility to the next, the sum of the two numbers 
increases by 2 -- and he could use that observation to "skip ahead" 
several choices to reach the answer more quickly.

In any case, your method was fine, although slower than mine.  But 
many 3rd graders would understand your method whereas they might not 
understand mine....
