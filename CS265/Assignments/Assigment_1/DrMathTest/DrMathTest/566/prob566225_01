Hi, Christopher --

Your message shows that you have put a lot of good thought into this 
problem.  From what you have written, I think you are analyzing this 
problem correctly except for one thing.  You indicate that you think 
the tie game counts as both a win and a loss.

Not so -- the tie game is not counted as either a win or a loss.  So 
one of the 16 games is the tie; the other 15 games are the wins and 
losses.  In those 15 games, figure out how many they needed to win 
to have won twice as many as they lost, and you will have the answer 
to the problem.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
