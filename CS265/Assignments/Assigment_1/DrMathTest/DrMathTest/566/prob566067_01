Hi 98,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Since b divides a^2,

  b*r = a^2

for some integer r, and r = a^2 / b.  So

  gcd(b, r) = 1,

so b and r are relatively prime.  Do you have a theorem that applies
when the product of two relative prime numbers is a square?  If not,
consider the prime factorization of b and of r, and how this relates
to the prime factorization of a.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
