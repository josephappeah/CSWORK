Okay. Then I should add that an "equation" is, by definition, 
something that contains an equal sign. What you are trying to 
simplify is an "expression". And you lied when you said you wanted 
to "solve" it, which means finding the value of a variable that makes 
an equation true. ;-)

The terms are very important when you are trying to communicate about 
math! A lot of people get these wrong.
