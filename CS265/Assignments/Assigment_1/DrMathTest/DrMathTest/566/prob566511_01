Hi Dionna,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You're on the right track, but in
your second step,

>     ln(x+4)(x-4)=9t
>     e^ln(x+4)(x-4)=e^ln9t

you have added a "ln" on the right side which is not in the original
equation.  You are taking the two expressions ln(x+4)(x-4) and 9t,
which are equal, and using them as exponents of e.  Since the two
exponents are equal, the two exponentials must be equal:

      e^[ln(x+4)(x-4)] = e^(9t)  ,

but there is no "ln" function on the right side. 

Try starting again from this point.  Your next equation

>     (x+4)(x-4)=9t

is almost correct, since you have a quadratic in x on the left
(correct), but the right side should be an exponential in t.

>I don't really know what "solve for x as a function of t" means...

It means that you can write a formula

    x = (formula in t) .

When you wrote

>     x^2-16=9t
>     (x^2-16)/9=t

you solved for t in terms of x, which is not what the problem asked.
If this were correct, you could write

   x^2 = 16 + 9t ,

and then

   x = +/- sqrt(16+9t) .

However, since the original problem wrote ln(x+4) and ln(x-4), and
since ln(y) is only defined for positive y, you must have both

   x + 4 > 0   and  x - 4 > 0 ,
or
       x > -4   and   x > 4 

(both inequalities must hold).

Therefore, no negative values of x are allowed, and

   x = sqrt(16 + 9t) .

However, that formula was wrong, so you need to correct it.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
