Hi Lisa,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

When you add sales tax, you multiply by 0.082 and then add that to 
the original value.

An item that costs $100 before tax will cost $108.20 after.

The formula for getting from the pre-tax price to the total price is:

  Total = preTax + 0.082*preTax

Which is equivalent to:

  Total = 1.082*preTax

So to find the pretax, we just divide both sides by 1.082:

  Total/1.082 = preTax

Does that help?
