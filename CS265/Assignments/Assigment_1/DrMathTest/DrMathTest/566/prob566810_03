Hi Jo,

>Thank you for your reply and in response to your question: ? x 4 = 12

Actually, it does.  It works with _any_ number (so long as you don't
try to divide by zero), and a percentage is just a number.  For
example, 8.33% is just
  
  8.33    833
  ---- = ----- = 0.0833
   100   10000

(Any percentage is just a fraction with 100 in the denominator.)

So given 

   y * 8.33% = 10.60

you can write 

   y * 0.0833 = 10.60

            y = 10.60 / 0.0833

This is the 'formula' you want.  But it's not really a formula.  It's
just using the relationship between multiplication and division. 

Does this help?
