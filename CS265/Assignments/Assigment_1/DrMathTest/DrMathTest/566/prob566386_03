Good.  Then think of it like this:

You really only have seven numbers to choose from, with the three
taken out being the spaces between the four numbers.  So you choose
ANY four numbers out of seven (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7),

  a, b, c, d (written in order)

and then the numbers

  a, b+1, c+2, d+3

will be numbers from 1 to 10, with no two numbers adjacent.  And there
is an exact correspondence because you can go backward:  If

  r, s, t, u

are four numbers from 1 to 10 with no two numbers adjacent (in order),
then

  r, s-1, t-2, u-3

are four (different) numbers from 1 to 7.

So do you know how many ways there are to choose four numbers out of
seven?
