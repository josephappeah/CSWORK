Hello, Von --

Answer A.

(1) The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is the set of all 
points equidistant from the endpoints of the segment.

(2) The endpoints of a chord of a circle are points on the circle 
and are therefore the same distance from the center of the circle.

From (1) and (2), a perpendicular bisector of a chord of a circle, 
containing as it does all the points equidistant from two points on 
a circle, in particular contains the center of the circle.  So if 
that perpendicular bisector is also a chord of the circle, then it 
is a chord which passes through the center of the circle, and so it 
is a diameter.
