Hi Patrick,

So we only have a partial description of the primitive solutions, and
we wonder about the other solutions.  Well, we *do* have

  (y + 2z + x)(y + 2z - 2x) = (2y + z - x)^2.

Can you prove that if gcd(x, y) = 1 then

  gcd(y + 2z + x, y + 2z - 2x) = 1 ?

Certainly not, but can you prove that the gcd must be a divisor of
three, perhaps?  (This time I checked that this is possible.)  Then we
just split into two cases:

If any one of these numbers is divisible by 3, then all three of them
are (this is easy to show), so and we are in the previous case, where
the first number is 3q^2 and the second is 3p^2.

If the gcd is not 3, then it must be 1 (since we have proven that the
gcd divides 3), then none of those three numbers can be divisible by
3.  Then we have q^2 is the first factor, and p^2 is the second, which
clearly implies that pq is the third, and then we solve for x, y, and z:

  p^2 = y + 2z - 2x
  q^2 = y + 2z + x
  pq  = 2y + z - x

  x = (q^2 - p^2)/3
  y = (2pq - p^2)/3
  z = (p^2 + q^2 - pq)/3.

Note that since p^2 and q^2 are not divisible by 3, they are both 1
mod 3, so that their difference is divisible by 3.  Also 

So we conclude that all primitive solutions are generated by the TWO
formulas:

  x = q^2 - p^2,
  y = 2pq - p^2,
  z = p^2 + q^2 - pq.

where p and q are relatively prime, and p+q is NOT divisible by 3
(otherwise x, y, and z are all divisible by 3), and

  x = (q^2 - p^2)/3,
  y = (2pq - p^2)/3,
  z = (p^2 + q^2 - pq)/3.

where p and q are relatively prime, and p+q IS divisible by 3 (so that
x, y, and z are all integers).

How does that work?  Can you prove the gcd above divides 3?
