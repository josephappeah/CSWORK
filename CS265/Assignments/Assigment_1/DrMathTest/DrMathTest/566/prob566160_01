John thank you for asking this question.

If the cube of n means n to the power 3. If we have 2 squared then we 
mean 2 to the power 2 which is 4. If we have 2 cubed then it means 2 
to the power 3.

To help you find the answer to your problem:

   n^3 = 9

We might consider to values for n and come up with an approximate 
answer.  Suppose n = 2 then we have 2 to the power 3 which is,

   2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8

Now suppose n = 2.1 then we have 2.1 to the power 3 which is,

  (2.1)^3 = 2.1 * 2.1 * 2.1 = 9.261

So we know that if, n^3 = 9 n must be bigger than 2 and less than 2.1

Some calculators have what is called a cube root key which you can 
use to get a better approximation. On my calculator the cubed root of 
9 is 2.080083823 however this is not an exact answer.

If you have more questions feel free to write back.
