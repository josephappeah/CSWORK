Hi Bones,

Start by taking a look at 

  Trigonometry in a Nutshell
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/53942.html

before reading further.

In fact, you can get away with just three of them: sine, cosine, and
tangent.  The others are just the reciprocals of these, so usually the
first thing I do when I see one is convert it to the more basic one,
e.g., 

                         sin(x)
  sin(x) * cot(2x)   ->  -------
                         tan(2x)

Their purpose is explained in the URL above:  there are sometimes
situations where you know some distances and angles, and you want to
be able to compute others that you can't measure directly. 
Trigonometry tells you that certain ratios of distances remain the
same, so long as certain angles remain unchanged.  And that lets you
fill in missing values. 

>i know trig leads into calculus 

Well, it doesn't, really.  Calculus is a whole other thing.  The
relationship between trig and calculus is this:  Calculus deals with
operations (differentiation and integration) that you can perform on
functions.  And trig functions are included in those functions.  But
you could learn calculus even if you'd never heard of trigonometry. 

>so i would like 
>to have a good understanding of trig before diving into calc.  

For a quick overview of calculus, see 

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52121.html

To get a better sense of how to prepare to take full advantage of a
course in calculus, see

Does this help?
