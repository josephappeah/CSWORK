Hi Cynthia.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  The following web page 
is helpful for subtraction and multiplication.

  Parts of a Subtraction Problem
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58801.html

And also note that there are other addition words as well.

For division, I think the words you want are "dividend", "divisor"
and "quotient" (but you should check to see which goes where!).
