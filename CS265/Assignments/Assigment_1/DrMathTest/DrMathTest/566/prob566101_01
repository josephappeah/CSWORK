Hi Xany,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The nature of the roots of a quadratic
equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 (a,b,c real) is shown by the discriminant:

   D = b^2 - 4ac .

When D > 0, there are two distinct real roots; when D = 0, there is
a double real root; and when D < 0, the roots are complex numbers.
When D < 0, since the roots are complex, there are no x-intercepts.
The graph is either entirely above, or entirely below, the x-axis.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
