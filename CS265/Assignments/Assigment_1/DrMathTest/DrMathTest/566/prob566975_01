The requirement that a transformation be linear places enormous
restrictions on the transformation.  If you know the value of T on
one vector u, then you automatically know its value on the entire
one-dimensional subspace consisting of multiples ku of u, where
k is a scalar.  Geometrically, this subspace is a line through 
the origin.

If you know the value of T on a second, linearly
independent vector v, then you know the value of T on the plane
spanned by the two vectors, because if you know T(u) and T(v),
then you know T(au+bv)=aT(u)+bT(v), and every vector w in the 
plane containing u and v is such a linear combination:

   w = au + bv .

(You can think of the lines au (all the scalar multiples of u)
and bv (all scalar multiples of v) as two axes, and passing
a line parallel to u through w, this line will intersect the line
of multiples of v at some point b*v, giving you the "v-coordinate"
b of w; similarly, you determine the "u-coordinate" of w:

          (multiples of v)
           /
          /
         /
       //----.w
  b*v //    /
     //    /
     O-------------------> (multiples of u)
      ---->
       a*u

So for linear transformations, a tiny amount of information
(for a linear transformation on R^2, the value of T on two
linearly independent vectors) determines the entire mapping.

In one dimension, the only linear transformations are T(x) = kx,
which are straight lines through the origin.

For your problem, think of the "point" (x,y) as the head of a 
directed line from the origin, the usual idea of a vector.  You
don't want to look at the x and y parts separately:

>I do realize that the given transformation maps x to (x-3) and 
>maps y to (y-2)...

Look at the vector you start with [i.e. (x,y)] and the vector you
wind up with, [ (x-3,y-2) ].

As for whether the map is linear, is it true that

   T(kx,ky) = k T(x,y) ?

Compute the two sides independently and see if they are the same.
If this is true, then you also need to determine whether

  T((x1,y1)+(x2,y2)) = T(x1+x2,y1+y2)
                     = T(x1,y1) + T(x2,y2) .

Again, compute the two sides independently and see if they are the
same.

Your solution in your "thoughts" section is correct.  See if the
above discussion makes it clearer.

If you have any questions, please write back and I 
will try to explain further.
