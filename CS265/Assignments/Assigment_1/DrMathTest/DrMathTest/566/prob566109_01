Hi Nicolas,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The key here lies in what you said in
your subject line, though what you said should be qualified,

  Raising a number to the power q^k (for any positive integer k) is a
linear transformation in any extension of the finite field with q
elements.

So that means that

  g1(x) = x^(q^s)

is a linear transformation, so you can write

  g1(a) = r_1*a_1 + r_2*a_2 + r_3*a_3 + ... + r_n*a_n

for numbers r_i in the field K, and

  g2(x) = x^(q^t)

and

  g3(x) = x^(q^u)

are linear as well.  So now think of your function as

  f(a) = g1(a)*g2(a) + g3(a),

and write out g1, g2, and g3 as linear combinations of the a_i's.  You
will find that you get quadratic terms and linear terms but nothing else.

Does that make sense?  If you have any questions about this or need
more help, please write back and show me what you have been able to
do, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
