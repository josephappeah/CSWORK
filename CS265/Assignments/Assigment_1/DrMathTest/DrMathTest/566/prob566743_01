Hi, "Mom" --

The approach to this problem depends on the age of your child.  For 
an 8th grader, basic algebra makes a problem like this relatively 
easy.  But I suspect your child is younger than that.  Fortunately, 
a common-sense approach (which turns out to be very nearly identical 
to the formal algebraic approach) can be used to solve the problem.

Think of it this way -- on a number line, if you are comfortable 
with number lines.  You start with some first number.  If you add 
some second number to the first, you end up at 39; if you subtract 
that same second number from the first, you end up at 11.

If you have the picture in your mind -- or better, on a piece of 
paper -- then you can see that the number you started with is 
halfway between the 39 and the 11 (because the number you added to 
get to 39 is the same as the number you subtracted to get to 11).  
So the first number is the number halfway between 39 and 11.

But the number halfway between two numbers is the average of the two 
numbers -- which we find by adding the two numbers and dividing by 
2.  So the first number is

  39+11   50
  ----- = -- = 25
    2      2

And then we see that the second number (which we have to add to 25 
to get 39 or subtract from 25 to get 11) is 14.  So the numbers we 
are looking for are 25 and 14.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
