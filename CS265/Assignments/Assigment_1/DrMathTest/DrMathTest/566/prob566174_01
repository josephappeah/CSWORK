Hi Gwen,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It's not a formula.  You have four
offers, and only the relative sizes (smallest, largest, etc) are
important, so you can call them

  r, s, t, and u

or just

  600, 800, 1000, and 1200.

It looks like we're assuming that she will get at least four offers
(otherwise option A has the advantage that she won't turn down her
only offer).  So you look at all 24 orders in which these offers could
come in.  It might be

  600, 800, 1000, 1200

or it might be

  1200, 800, 1000, 600

or a variety of other things.  Of those 24 possibilities, how many
times will she get $600 for her notebooks if she uses option A?  And
how about $800?  What if she uses option B?  Which option is best?

Can you work it out, now?  If you have any questions about this or
need more help, please write back and show me what you have been able
to do, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
