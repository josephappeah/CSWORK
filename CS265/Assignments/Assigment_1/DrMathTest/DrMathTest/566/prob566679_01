Let's try an experiment.  Suppose I set y equal to 0.  What is the
value of x?  It's -4, isn't it?  So (-4,0) is on the line.

What if I set y equal to 1?  The value of x is still -4, so (-4,1) is
also on the line. 

Try graphing the points (-4,0) and (-4,1).  Use a ruler to complete
the line.  What do you notice about all the points on the line?
