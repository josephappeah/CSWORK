Hi Anne.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  A (regular) hexagon is a 
2-dimensional figure, and has an area:

But I don't know what you mean by 3D-hexagon.  Do you mean
hexagonal prism?  See this page:

I hope that this helps.  Please write back and clarify your
question if I misunderstood it.
