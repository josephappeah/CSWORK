Lately, I've been thinking about problems like that in this way:

    -7 + 3

  = (-4 + -3) + 3

  = -4 + (-3 + 3)

  = -4

and

    -7 - 3

  = 0 - 7 - 3

  = 0 - (7 + 3)

  = 0 - 10

  = -10

Do you think this might work for her? 

But if I had to guess, I'd say that she's probably not ready to be
thinking about negative numbers yet, perhaps because she hasn't
completely mastered arithmetic using positive numbers yet.  So you
might first see if she can explain to _you_ how to use things like
arrows and number lines to add and subtract positive numbers.  Then
you can extend that understanding to work with negative numbers as well. 

In any case, she's certainly not ready for algebra, and I wonder if it
won't make things worse trying to teach it to her at this stage. 
Mostly what she'll learn, I think, is to hate math.

It might be a mistake to focus too intently on 'goals' at this point.
   It's more important that she learn that she's allowed to do
anything to one side of an equation (except divide by zero!), so long
as she does the same thing to the other side.  It's not required that
the thing she chooses to do has to be particularly helpful!

For example, if she starts with 

  6 - x = 10

and she wants to add 6 to both sides, let her.  The important thing is
that she actually does it correctly:

  6 + 6 - x = 6 + 10

     12 - x = 16

She's no worse off at this point, but she doesn't need to worry about
whether this was the 'right' thing to do.  Let her play around with
doing different operations to both sides of an equation, and just make
sure that she realizes that multiplication and division have to be
applied to _everything_, e.g., 

  2 * (12 - x) = 2 * (16)

But as I said earlier, until she's mastered positive arithmetic, she's
not really ready for negative arithmetic; and until she's mastered
negative arithmetic, she's not really ready for algebra. 

Does this help?  You might also consider submitting your question to
our Teacher2Teacher service,

  http://mathforum.org/t2t/

where it can get attention from math teachers (as opposed to
mathematicians, which is what we have at Ask Dr. Math).
