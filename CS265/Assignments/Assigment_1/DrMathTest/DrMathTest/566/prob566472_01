Hi Brian,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Your friend is right.

    -1       1
  10    =  ----
            10

In fact, if you raise a positive number to ANY power, you will always
get a positive number.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
