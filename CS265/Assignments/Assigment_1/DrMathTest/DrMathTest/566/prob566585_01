You are probably supposed to keep everything in the given order and 
insert parentheses:

       3
  2 * 3  + 4

But to get such a large number, you will have to either raise a 
larger number than 3 to a power, or raise something to a larger power 
than the 3rd, or both.

Can you use (3+4) as the exponent?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
