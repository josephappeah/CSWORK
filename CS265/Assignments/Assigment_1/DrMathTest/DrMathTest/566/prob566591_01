Hi Chris,

To find the area, we can multiply the length by the width:

   area = length * width

We're given the area, 

  10 m^2 = length * width

and we're given the width, 

  10 m^2 = length * 0.08 m

So now what?  Well, let's stop and think for a moment about something
I'll bet you've seen before.  Note that the following

  12 = 3 * 4         12 / 3 = 4           12 / 4 = 3

are three different ways of saying exactly the same thing.  So if
someone asked you to solve this, 

  12 = ? * 3

you could find the answer by rewriting it in one of the other forms:

  12 / 3 = ?

Your problem looks an awful lot like that, doesn't it?
