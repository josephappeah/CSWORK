You can use the formula given here:

  Bearing Between Two Points
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55417.html

The difference between the bearings of two vectors will be the angle 
between them.

Since your points are so close together, you could also use the 
planar approximation given halfway down the following page to get 
(x,y) coordinates of each vector, then use the scalar product.
