Hi Zach,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Technically, the factorial is only
defined for positive (real) integers.  So that means that (1/2)! is
meaningless.  But there is a continuous function defined for all
positive real numbers which is equal to the factorial on the positive
integers, and that function is

  gamma(x+1).

And so some people write x! when they really mean gamma(x+1).  The
gamma function is defined for all real numbers except the negative
integers (where the function approaches infinity) and is it, in fact,
defined on the complex numbers.  So if there is such a thing as a
complex factorial, then it is the gamma function.  For more
information on the gamma function, see the page on MathWorld, at

  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GammaFunction.html

If you have any other questions about this or need more help, please
write back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try
to offer further suggestions.
