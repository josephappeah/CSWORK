I can't quite figure out what the problem means.

When you say "the n square of 2", do you just mean it has the 
expression

   2
  n

which is read as "n squared"?

inside each box, along with a square of dots? So does it look like 
this?

  +--------+  +--------+  +--------+
  |   oo   |  |   ooo  |  |  oooo  |
  |   oo   |  |   ooo  |  |  oooo  |
  |        |  |   ooo  |  |  oooo  |
  |        |  |        |  |  oooo  |
  |        |  |        |  |        |
  |    2   |  |    2   |  |    2   |
  |   n    |  |   n    |  |   n    |
  +--------+  +--------+  +--------+

In any case, I don't know what "problem" you are supposed to "solve" 
by choosing one of the expressions you list. Are there any 
instructions telling you what it all means? Is the question about 
deciding what would go in the fourth box, or finding the number of 
dots in box n, or what?
