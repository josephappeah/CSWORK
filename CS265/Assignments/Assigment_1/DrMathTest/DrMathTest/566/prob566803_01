Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The decimal representation of pi does not terminate. That is different
from saying that pi is "never-ending", which doesn't have a clear
definition.

There's no reason this cannot occur. It doesn't mean pi is infinite.
It just means we cannot finite represent pi using decimal numbers. The
fact that such numbers exist, such as the square root of 2 (whose
digits do not terminate), was well known to the Greeks.

If you would like a proof of that fact, refer to:

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55828.html

You will need a bit of calculus to understand the proof, however, the
fact is that the matter has been proven.

I will make one note of caution: "evidence" in mathematics is
different from "evidence" in science. In science, one examines real
world data and hypothesizes. One then creates an experiment to test
the hypothesis. This is not true in mathematics. You don't just test
things out. You proof things using definition, axioms, and logic.
