Hi Jenny.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  Do you mean "hexagon", 
rather than "hexagram"?  If so, the following web pages may be 
helpful:

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.regpoly.html
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.triangle.html

But if you did really mean "hexagram", please write back and
clarify your question with a picture, if you can.
