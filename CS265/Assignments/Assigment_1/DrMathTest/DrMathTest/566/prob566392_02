Hi Amy,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Well we need to make some equations.  The first step in that is 
coming up with variables.  Let's call the number of girls "x" and the 
number of boys "y".

What do we know about the class?  We know there are 26 students 
total, so we can write this equation:

  x + y = 26

Now each girl drew a triangle.  That means each girl drew 3 sides.  
Each boy drew a rectangle (4 sides).

So the total number of sides is 3 times x plus 4 times y:

  3x + 4y = 92

Let's go back to the first equation:

  x + y = 26

To solve that for x, let's subtract y from both sides:

  x = 26 - y

If x is equal to (26-y), then we can take "x" and replace it with "26-
y".  So we can change equation 2 to:

  3(26-y) + 4y = 92

Or

  3*26 - 3y + 4y = 92

Or:

  78 - 3y + 4y = 92

Or

  78 + y = 92

Can you find y?

Once you find y, can you go back to the first equation and use that 
to find x?

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
