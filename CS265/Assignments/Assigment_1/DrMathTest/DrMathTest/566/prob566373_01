You would use generating functions.  The number of 4-letter words 
that can be made from 2 A's, 2 B's and 2 C's is the coefficient of 
x^4/4! in the expansion of

   (1 + x + x^2/2!)^3   which expands to

 1 + 3x + (9/2)x^2 + 4x^3 + (9/4)x^4 + (3/4)x^5 + (1/8)x^6

The coefficient of x^4 is 9/4  and of x^/4! is  4!(9/4)

                                             =  54

So there are 54 possible 4-letter 'words' made from 2 A's, 2 B's and 
2 C's.


If order doesn't matter the number of combinations of 4 letters is 
the coefficient of x^4 in the expansion of

    (1 + x + x^2)^3

 =   1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 7x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6

And the coefficient of x^4 is 6, so there are 6 combinations of 4 
letters from 2 A's, 2 B's and 2 C's.
