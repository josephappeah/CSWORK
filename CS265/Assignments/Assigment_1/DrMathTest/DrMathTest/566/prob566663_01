This isn't really an issue, because the works of Shakespeare are finite.

If we restrict 'literary work' to include only works of finite length,
then any infinity is large enough to cover them, and the lack of
correspondence between types of inifinity aren't relevant.

If you consider letters (and punctuation) to be symbols in a numeric
base larger than 10, it should be clear that there aren't any problems
that arise when dealing with sequences of letters that wouldn't also
arise when dealing with sequences of digits.  

That is, suppose you selected a number with a huge (but finite) number
of digits; and the monkeys only hit the numeric keys on their
keyboards.  Would you have any reason to believe that they wouldn't,
given infinite time, get around to duplicating your number? 

The only difference is that we typically impart 'meaning' to sequences
of letters, but not to sequences of digits.

But again, we wouldn't be asking them to type out every possible
decimal number.  We'd be picking a finite set of decimal numbers, and
'asking' them to type out those.  It's a different kind of problem.

You've more or less answered your own question.  If when thinking
about decimal numbers, you restrict yourself to a finite set of them
(and provide for some way of representing repeating expansions), then
you're in the same situation you're in with literary works.  

Remember, when writing a literary work, if you're not finished yet,
you _could_ keep adding symbols, just as when specifying a decimal
number, you _could_ keep adding digits.  But at some point, you stop.
 And it's after you stop that the monkeys go to work. 

Does this help?
