Hi Anne.

I'm afraid I don't understand your work here.  I don't know 
to what you refer when you mention the spherical cap.  Also, beware
of assuming that the hexagonal close pack and cubic close pack 
arrangements are the optimal arrangements for the given box
(hexagonal prism).  They may be, but that remains to be shown.
The 0.74 number is appropriate only for very large container 
volumes--or where the effect of the container is essentially
negligible.

Can you tell me which website you found this problem?
