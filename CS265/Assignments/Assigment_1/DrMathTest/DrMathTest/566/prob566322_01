Hi, 

Let me see if I understand you.  You have a cone, with a base diameter
of 0.628.  You turn it upside-down, so the base faces upwards.  You
put a sphere with diameter 0.500 into the cone.  And you want to know
how much of the sphere is within the cone? 

Is that right? 

Note that just knowing the base of the cone isn't enough.  You'd have
to know the height of the cone as well, or the slant height, or
something else that would completely determine its dimensions. 

Is this a real-world problem, or a classroom/textbook problem?
