OK, you're right that dlat < 0 and dlong > 0, so you're in the case

There are major problems with my algorithm, starting with the fact 
that the conditions should be based on the signs of x and y, not dlon 
and dlat. Here is a correction:

  dlat = lat2 - lat1
  dlon = lon2 - lon1
  y = sin(lon2-lon1)*cos(lat2)
  x = cos(lat1)*sin(lat2)-sin(lat1)*cos(lat2)*cos(lon2-lon1)
  if y > 0 then
    if x > 0 then tc1 = 90 - arctan(y/x)
    if x < 0 then tc1 = 270 + arctan(-y/x)
    if x = 0 then tc1 = 0
  if y < 0 then
    if x > 0 then tc1 = 90 + arctan(-y/x)
    if x < 0 then tc1 = 270 - arctan(y/x)
    if x = 0 then tc1 = 180
  if y = 0 then
    if x > 0 then tc1 = 90
    if x < 0 then tc1 = 270
    if x = 0 then [the 2 points are the same]

Thanks for your persistence which has led to catching a significant 
error. I do not have time to fully debug algorithms like this. Could 
you please test it with input that exercises each of the cases? When 
we're confident that it is correct, I will have our archivist make 
the correction.
