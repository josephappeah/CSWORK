I'm not sure where you got the 565.5% and 191% (I get 1205% in that 
last example, and in the first you divided by the actual rather than 
the objective); but you're right that the formula doesn't make sense 
in this case. For your original problem, I get

  4,972 - -23,150
  --------------- * 100% = -121.5%
      -23,150

and the real problem is that it comes out negative. This is correct, 
but very hard to interpret. The percentage difference concept is 
inappropriate here.
