Hi Walter.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  I am an airline traveler, 
my father worked on B757 and 767 landing gear for Boeing, and I 
have a good friend that flew 747's and D-10s for United before
retiring a few years ago.  So I have a personal stake in this type 
of problem.

If it were me, I would compute the actual average LPO by 
tracking every single individual brake--you have the records, so
you should be able to do this, even for all 556 brakes.  You can
find the dates of its last two overhauls, and compute the number
of landings between them.  You might also wish to include more 
recent data (i.e., since last overhaul); you could do this by 
choosing the minimum of the following two quantities:  

  1.  actual landings since last overhaul,
  2.  an "expected" number of landings (can be 1250, or perhaps
      the average number of landings for this aircraft--it may
      vary by specific aircraft (for instance, an airplane that 
      is used to locations with shorter runways might have 
      increased brake use).

Of course you may not want to include this recent [and therefore
incomplete (#1) or estimated (#2)] data.  I emphasize that the 
exact choice of how to go about this computation properly depends 
on the nature of the industry.  I presume that in certain cases 
not all brakes are simultaneously overhauled on a given aircraft, 
so that the number of landings must be tracked on a brake-by-brake
basis.

My belief is that "target LPO" and "average LPO" should either be
industry standard terms.  If they are not, then they should be 
spelled out in the contract.

Having said all this, I will suggest that you consult a operations 
engineer, and I expect that United has some qualified staff.  This 
type of problem is exactly what they are trained to do, and they 
will understand which concepts are important from the business 
point of view.
