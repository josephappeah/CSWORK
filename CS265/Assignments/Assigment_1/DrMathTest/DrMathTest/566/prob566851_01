Hi, Todd --

It's always a lot easier to see what to do if we arrange the problem 
in the traditional vertical format:

    MEAT
  + TEAM
  ------
    GAME

From there, there are always many different paths to take towards a 
solution of the problem.

Here are the significant things I notice first:

(1) The sum of two 4-digit numbers is a 4-digit number, so the sum 
of M and T is at most 9.

(2) In the 1's column, the sum of M and T gives digit E; in the 
1000s column, the same sum of M and T gives a different digit G.  
This means there is a "carry" from the 100s column to the 1000s 
column.  This in turn means that  (a) E is 5 or greater; and  (b) G 
is 1 more than E -- which now means the sum of M and T is at most 8.

These observations immediately severely limit the possibilities for 
the values of E and G; we must have one of the following:

  (E,G) = (5,6)
  (E,G) = (6,7)
  (E,G) = (7,8)
  (E,G) = (8,9)

Next I see that

(3) In the 100s column, E plus E -- possibly with a "carry" or 
possibly without -- gives digit "A"; and

(4) in the 10s column, A plus A -- without a "carry", because T plus 
M is less than 10 -- gives digit M.

Now we consider each of the possibilities for (E,G) determined 
earlier along with items (3) and (4).

Suppose (E,G) = (5,6).  Then from (3), A is either 0 or 1.  But if A 
is either 0 or 1, there is no "carry" from the 10s column to the 
100s column, so A would have to be 0.  But then (4) tells us that M 
would also have to be 0.  And different letters stand for different 
digits, so this is not possible -- and also the problem says the 
digits are between 1 and 9, so 0 is not allowed.

Suppose (E,G) = (6,7).  Then from (3), A is either 2 or 3.  Again, 
in either case, there is no "carry" from the 10s column, so A would 
have to be 2.  Then (4) tells us that M would have to be 4.  Then in 
the 1s column, M plus T would have to be equal to E, making T equal 
to 2.  But then A and T are both 2, which is not allowed.

Suppose (E,G) = (7,8).  Then from (3), A is either 4 or 5.  In this 
case, either possibility is okay.  If A=4, then there is no "carry" 
from the 10s column to the 100s column, making the digit A in the 
100s place of the sum correct; and if A=5, then there IS a "carry", 
and this again makes the digit A in the 100s place of the sum 
correct.  However, if A=4, then (4) tells us M=8; but G is 8, so 
this is not a possibility.  And if A=5, then (4) tells us M=0; but 
none of the letters is supposed to be 0.

Suppose (E,G) = (8,9).  Then from (3), A is either 6 or 7.  But only 
the 7 is possible, because if A is either 6 or 7 then there is 
a "carry" from the 10s column to the 100s column, so the digit A in 
the 100s column of the sum must be odd.  Since A is 7, (4) tells us 
that M is 4.  But then in the 1s column, M plus T giving digit E 
tells us that T must also be 4, which is not allowed.

We have examined all the possible solutions to the problem, and none 
of them works.  So in this case, unless I have made a mistake in my 
logic or my arithmetic, the problem as you show it has no solution.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.  Especially write back if you know that 
the problem has a solution.
