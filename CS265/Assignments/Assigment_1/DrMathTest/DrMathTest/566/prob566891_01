Hello Mary Lou,

I'll assume that we want the concentration to be the same.

If in a cleaning solution we have 10 oz of bleach in 100 ounces of water, then
the fraction of bleach in cleaning solution is

10/(100+10)  

You said " if i only have 7 ounces of cleaning solution"  but I think you must mean 7 oz of 
bleach.  Acting on that assumption, we want

7/(w+7) = 10/(100+10)

7/(w+7) = 10/110 = 1/11

77=w+7

w=70.

Your answer is correct.  Good work.
