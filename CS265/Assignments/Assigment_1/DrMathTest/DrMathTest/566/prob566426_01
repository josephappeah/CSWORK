Hi Aimee,

I'm a little confused by the description of the situation (in
particular, where the outlet is located), but it sounds like you're on
the right track.  

Each slice of water will be rectangular.  The length of the rectangle
will be the length of the tank.  The width of the rectangle will be
the length of the chord across the circular cross-section of the tank
at the given height.  To see how you'd go about representing that, try
searching our archive for the keyword 'dipstick'.  

Does this help?
