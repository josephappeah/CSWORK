Could you remind me what your input data are for this example? If you 
told me before, it is lost because you didn't always respond using 
the link in our e-mails. If I have the inputs, I can run them through 
my spreadsheet and check it out.

My first thought is that, if by "the direct formula" you mean the one 
with atan2(), you may be using the direct formula incorrectly. The 
atan2() function works differently in different systems (the two 
arguments are sometimes interchanged), and this could account for an 
error of 90 degrees.
