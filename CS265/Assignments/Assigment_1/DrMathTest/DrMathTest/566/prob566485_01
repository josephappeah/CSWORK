Hi Chris,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  An interval can be finite or
infinite.  A finite interval is the set of all points between
two given points (called the endpoints), which may or may not
be part of the set.  That is, a finite interval is a set of 
one of the following forms:

   {x: a < x < b}
   {x: a <= x < b}
   {x: a < x <= b}
   {x: a <= x <= b}  .

An interval which contains neither endpoint is called an "open"
interval, and an interval which contains both endpoints is called
"closed".  If the interval contains one endpoint but not the other,
it is sometimes called "half-open".  Interval notation provides
a more compact representation of the above sets, by writing the
endpoints, separated by a comma, with the smaller endpoint on the 
left.  The inclusion of the endpoint is indicated by using a 
bracket ("[" or "]"), and the exclusion of an endpoint by using a
parenthesis ( "(" or ")" ).  With this notation, the four intervals
above are written

   {x: a < x < b} = (a,b)
   {x: a <= x < b} = [a,b) 
   {x: a < x <= b} = (a,b]
   {x: a <= x <= b} = [a,b] .

Intervals can also be infinite, of the form

   {x: a < x}
   {x: a <= x}
   {x: x < b}
   {x: x <= b}

(or even all real numbers).

The first two sets have left endpoints, but no right endpoint.  To
indicate this, the special symbol which looks somewhat like a 
figure 8 lying on its side is used, which I will denote "oo".
It is called "infinity", but it is not a number - just a symbol
indicating that there is no endpoint on one side of the interval.
If the left endpoint is missing, the symbol "-oo" is used.  As
above, a bracket indicates the inclusion of the endpoint in the
interval, and a parenthesis indicates the exclusion of the 
endpoint.

The intervals above are denoted

   {x: a < x} = (a,oo)
   {x: a <= x} = [a,oo)
   {x: x < b} = (-oo,b)
   {x: x <= b} = (-oo,b] .

You never use a bracket with the oo or -oo symbol.  The entire 
real line is sometimes indicated by (-oo,oo) or (-oo,+oo).

The answer to your question

>"we write the inequality x > a as [a, 00). True or False"  

would be false, since the inequality is strict (so x = a does not
belong to the interval), while a belongs to the interval [a,oo).

If you have any questions, please write back and I 
will try to explain further.
