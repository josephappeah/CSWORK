Hi Deanna,

You'll learn more if you do it.  Let's take it one step at a time:

  First, use the two points to find the slope (which is the 
  ratio of the change in y to the change in x, or 'rise over 
  run').  

If I give you two points, like (2,3) and (6,5), can you compute the
slope between these points?  Try drawing a picture:

    -
    |
    -                 B             A = (2,3)
    |                 .             B = (6,5)
    -                 .
    |                 .
    -     A............
    |
    -
    |
    -
    |
  --+--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--

When you move from point A to point B, what's the change in x?  What's
the change in y?
