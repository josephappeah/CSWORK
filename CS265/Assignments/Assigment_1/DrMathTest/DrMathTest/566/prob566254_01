Hi C.J.,

I think the following answers from the Dr. Math archive will tell 
you what you want to know: 

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/53403.html
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51933.html

I found them by searching on these keywords:

  epsilon delta  (all keywords)

(the symbol you call sigma is actually the Greek letter delta,
in the most common notation for limits, and formal arguments are
called epsilon delta proofs)

You can find other similar answers by doing the same search at

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/mathgrepform.html

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
