Hi Steve,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  I suppose you can view the process of
finding a common denominator as a process of writing fractions in a
different base, it doesn't seem a natural viewpoint to me - this
"cure" seems to be worse than the disease, to me.  Many students have
a hard time with the idea of representations of integers in different
bases, so I don't see why thinking about fractions in a different
base is going to be simpler.

I would use ideas based on common units.  Suppose you mix two 2-liter
bottles of ginger ale with three quarts of apple cider and a pint of
cranberry juice.  How much liquid will you have?    

If you have three boxes, one 18 inches high, one 50 cm high, and  you 
stack one on top of the other, how high will the stack be?

You can only make sense of such questions and determine the answer if
all quantities are measured in the same units, and when you find a 
common denominator, you are writing all fractions in the same "units".

This is somewhat more reasonable, but relying entirely (or even
conceptually) on decimals has its own problems.  If students don't 
learn how to deal with rational numbers (i.e. quotients of integers),
they are probably going to have a difficult time when they have to 
consider symbolic fractions in algebra such as rational functions,
which are quotients of polynomials.  Understanding the algebra of
rational functions such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, or 
dividing fractions with polynomials in the numerator and denominator
will be very difficult if you can't do the same calculations with
integer numerators and denominators and use those as a model for
the algebraic computations.

If you have any questions, please write back and I will try to 
explain further.
