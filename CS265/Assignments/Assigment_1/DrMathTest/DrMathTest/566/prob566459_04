Hi Vijay,

>why logarithm of a number to the base one is not defined.

It's basically the same explanation as before. 

If 

   a
  b  = c

then 

  log (c) = a
     b

So if 
  
  log (c) = a
     1

then 

   a
  1  = c

but there's no way to raise 1 to any power and end up with anything
but 1.  So log(base 1) is undefined. 

Actually, I think you'll find that most questions of the form 'Why is
such-and-such undefined?' can be answered this way, i.e., by starting
from the definitions and showing that going in a certain direction
leads to an impossible situation. 

>what is 'limit  ( x to the power of 3/2) as x ---> 0 .

If you start taking smaller and smaller values of x, you'll see that
they get closer and closer to zero.  And in the limit itself, 

   3/2
  0    = 0

so there's no discontinuity. Is there some reason you thought that the
limit might be something other than zero?
