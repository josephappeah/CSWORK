Hello, Rocco --

You have two separate questions here....

Regarding the "height" of the triangle, we can't tell what "the" 
height is, because every triangle has three different "heights", 
depending on which side you consider to be the "base".  In your 
particular example, with the area being 126,324 square feet and one 
side being 760 feet, if we consider that known side to be 
the "base", then we can determine the height of the triangle (using 
the triangle formula area equals one-half base times height) to be 
about 332.4 feet.

But that is only one of the possible answers for the height, because 
the "heights" measured using each of the other sides as the "base" 
will (in most cases) be different.

As for the lengths of the other two sides (and therefore the heights 
considering those sides as the base), there is not enough 
information to determine them.  Consider the following crude diagram:

           R
  P <------------------------------------------------> Q
           |
           | 332.4 ft
           |
      A ------------------ B
           S   760 ft

Line AB is the known side of your triangle, with length 760 feet.  
RS is the height of the triangle using AB as the base; we have 
determined its length to be about 332.4 feet.  The third corner of 
your triangle, C, could be ANYWHERE on the (infinitely long) line 
PQ; regardless of where it is on that line, the base is still 760 
feet and the height is still 332.4 feet, so the area is 126,324 
square feet.

In order to determine the lengths of the other two sides, we need 
some more information, like one (or more) of the angles of the 
triangle.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you can provide any further 
information about the shape of the piece of land; or if you have any 
further questions about any of this.
