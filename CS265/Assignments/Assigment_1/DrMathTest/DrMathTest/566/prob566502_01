As far as anyone knows, there is no easy way to do this.  A lot of
modern cryptography is based on the hope that there is no easy
way.

There are sophisticated computer programs that can search for
factors relatively quickly, but if the numbers have hundreds of
digits, the programs may not find the factors in a million years.

There are methods to check relatively quickly to see if a large
number is prime.  But if the check shows that it is not prime,
finding the factors can be very difficult indeed.

You can surely find information about this on the web by searching
for things like "cryptography factor large primes"  and similar.
