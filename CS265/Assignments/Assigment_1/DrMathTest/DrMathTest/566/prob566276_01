Hi Saadia,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  A geometric progression or series 
has the form

   a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ...

and its sum is 

      a
    -----
    1 - r   .

What does the first statement 

...the sum of first two terms is 6...

tell you? (It gives you an equation for a and r)

Then

>...every term is four times the sum of all the terms that follow 
>it...

says that for every n,

   ar^n = 4*[ar^(n+1) + ar^(n+2) + ar^(n+3) + ...]

Using the two equations, and the general information about geometric
series above, you can determine a and r?  
   
If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
