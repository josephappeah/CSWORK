Right.  You probably covered it back in 3rd or 4th grade, without ever
being told why you'd want to understand it, and in pre-algebra your
teachers assumed you remembered it.  That's pretty typical.  Wouldn't
it make more sense to defer introducing it until you've got some
reason for learning it?

That's a good start.  The step you're missing is seeing that you can
write a product in that kind of form.  For example, 

  9 * 499 = 9(500 - 1)

In this form, it's easy:  9*500 is 4500, and then you subtract 9 from
it.  Number (14) above is already in the right form, although you may
not realize it.  That is, when we write something like 

  2 1/3 (2 and 1/3)

we're really just leaving out an implied '+' symbol:

  2 1/3 = 2 + 1/3

So 

  27(2 1/3) = 27(2 + 1/3)

            = 27(2) + 27(1/3)

Often learning to apply a particular technique is the easy part. 
What's harder is learning to recognize situations in which you
_should_ apply it.  

A very important attitude to develop in learning mathematics is what I
would call 'constructive laziness', by which I mean, you want to get
in the habit of looking at something like 

  21 * 1004

and immediately thinking something like "Ugh!  Is there some wayI can
turn this into an easier problem?"

One way to do that is to think about whether you really need a precise
answer!  If you're thinking about a situation where 20 people are
going to do something that costs $1004 per person, for planning
purposes you might decide that 20*1000 = 20,000 is close enough to the
real value that you don't need to do the actual multiplication. 

A second way to deal with this would be to use the distributive
property to change the product into a sum of easier products, so you
can do the whole thing in your head:

  21 * 1004 = 21(1000 + 4) = 21*1000 + 21*4

                           = 21,000 + 84

Getting used to seeing that you can do this is the point of the
exercises you've been given.  

For a review of the distributive property (including a preview of why
you should become very, very familiar with it), see

and write back if it's not clear, or if you still have questions.  For
more on the subject of how mathematics is largely 'applied laziness', see

I hope this helps!  Write back if you'd like to talk more about this,
or anything else.
