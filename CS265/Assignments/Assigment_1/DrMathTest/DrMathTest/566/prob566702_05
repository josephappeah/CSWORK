Hi Ashley!

Mathematically, the slope of a line is the change in the y values (the
'rise') divided by the change in the x values (the 'run').  A good way
to think of it is 'rise over run'.  

Basically, if you know the slope of a line you know how far the line 
rises and how far it moves to the right.  For example, if we have a 
line 

   y = 2/3 x + 7

this line has a slope of 2/3.  This means that if we look at it on a 
graph, it will go up 2 units for every 3 units it moves to the 
right.

If we know two points that lie on the line, we can find the slope by 
finding the change in the y's divided by the change in the x's.

For example, let's say we have a line that passes through the points 
(2,3) and (4,5).  Then the slope ("m" stands for slope) can be found 
by

    m = (y_1 - y_2)/(x_1 - x_2)

      = (3 - 5)/(2 - 4)

      = -2/-2 

      = 1.

One thing to keep in mind is that your choices for y_1 and x_1 must 
come from the same point and y_2 and x_2 must come from the same 
point.

Also, some lines have negative slope--all this means is that the 
line is moving down as it moves to the right.

If you have any more questions, let me know!
