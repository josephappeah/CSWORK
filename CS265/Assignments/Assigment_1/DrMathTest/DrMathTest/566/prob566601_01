Hi Jill,

I think the following answer from the Dr. Math archive will tell 
you what you want to know: 

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58174.html

In your problem, 143/104 reduces to 11/8, and this is the only
fraction which can be written with a denominator with factors of
only 2 and 5.

I found it by searching on these keywords:

  terminating decimal  (phrase)

You can find other similar answers by doing the same search at

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
