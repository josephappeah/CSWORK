Hi Eddie.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

Can you clarify your problem?  How are you defining the plane and 
the cube?  It's likely that we can help, but we need a more precise
description of what you're looking for.

One way to start is to imagine a three-dimensional coordinate
system (x,y,z), and that two opposite corners of the cube are
located at (0,0,0) and (1,1,1), and that the edges and faces of
the cube are lined up with the coordinate axes.

Then you can specify the plane by giving three points that it passes
through.
