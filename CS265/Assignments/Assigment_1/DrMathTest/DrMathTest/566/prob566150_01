Hi Robyn,

Since all the courses cost the same amount, it must be true that

  (number of courses) * (cost per course) = total

Does that make sense?  In your case, you know the number of courses
(just add them up), and the total.  So you can find the cost per
course this way:

  cost per course = total / (number of courses)

Does this help?
