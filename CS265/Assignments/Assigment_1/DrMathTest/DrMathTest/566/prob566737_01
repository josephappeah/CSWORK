Hi, Steve --

Yes, this kind of problem can be very confusing.  The final is 25% 
of your grade and your other test are (presumably) 75% of your 
grade.  These percentages represent 1/4 of your grade and 3/4 of 
your grade -- so you want to count your average on the 7 tests as 3 
tests and your score on the final as 1 test.

So you have

  average on first 7 tests:
    (94+90+88+88+86+84+80)/7 = 610/7 = 87.1...

  score on final: 91.7

Then your overall average is found by counting your earlier test 
average 3 times as much as the score on the final:

  average = (3(87.1...) + 91.7)/4 = 88.28...

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
