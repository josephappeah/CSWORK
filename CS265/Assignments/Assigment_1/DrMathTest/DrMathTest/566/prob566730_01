Hi Dirk,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Actually, you don't have to assume
that f is differentiable at Xo, only that f is continuous at Xo.

To show that 

   f'(Xo) = lim  f(X)
           X->Xo

you need to use the definition of derivative:

                 f(X) - f(Xo)
   f'(Xo) = lim  ------------  .
           X->Xo    X - Xo

Your hypotheses are that f'(Xo) exists, and

   lim f'(X) = L    exists (L is finite) .
  X->Xo

Try using the Mean Value Theorem to relate the limit of the 
difference quotient

   f(X) - f(Xo)
   ------------
      X - Xo

to the limit of derivatives.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
