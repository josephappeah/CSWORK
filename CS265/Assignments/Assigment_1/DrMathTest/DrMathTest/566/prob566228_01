Hi Kathy,

>I have a small swim pool for my grandkids.  It is 1-1/2 foot 
>deep ... 5 feet wide and 10 feet long.  How many gallons of water 
>will it take to fill it?

I assume it's rectangular in shape, when viewed from above?  If so,
then the volume is 

    5 ft * 10 ft * 1 1/2 ft

  = 75 ft^3

There are about 7.5 gallons in a cubic foot, so the total number of
gallons would be

  75 ft^3 * 7.5 gal/ft^3 = 562.5 gal

>pool demisions:  22" deep (but I will only fill it to 12"), 72" wide 
>and 120" in length.

Note that 72" is 6 feet, not 5 feet.  And 12 inches is 1 foot, not
1 1/2 feet.  So the calculation would be 

    6 ft * 10 ft * 1 ft

  = 60 ft^3

and

  60 ft^3 * 7.5 gal/ft^3 = 450 gal

If you'd like to use other measurements, you can follow these examples.  

Does this help?
