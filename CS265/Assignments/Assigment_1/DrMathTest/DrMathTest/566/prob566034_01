Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

This is a rate problem. Remember that:

   work = rate * time

For person A:

  1 pool = rate * 30 min

    rate = 1/30 pool/min

For person B:

  1 pool = rate * 45 min
    rate = 1/45 pool/min

For person C:

  1 pool = rate * 90 min
    rate = 1/90 pool/min

Their combined rate (if they all work together) is:

   1/30 + 1/45 + 1/90 = 6/90 pool/min
                      = 1/15 pool/min

   work = rate * time
   time = work / rate
        = 1 pool / (1/15 pool/min)
        = 15 min

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
