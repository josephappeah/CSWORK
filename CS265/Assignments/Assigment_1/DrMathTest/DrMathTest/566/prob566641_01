Hi Edward,

 -(X)**2 and -X**2 mean the same thing. the ** is always applied
before any + or - operation (since exponentiation is essentially
multiplication, and multiplications always happen before additions).

So, in your case X=4, if actually meant to write (-4)(-4) you
would have to write that as (-4)**2, NOT as -4**2, which equals
-(4)(4) = -16.

If you actually meant (-X)(-X), you should ALWAYS write that
as (-X)**2  [or as (-X)^2]. You need the parenthesis there
to force the minus to be applied first, i.e. *before* the 
exponentiation.

I hope this clears any confusion!

Let us know if you have any more questions.
