If you are learning algebra, try using a variable to represent the 
length of a side of the square. Write expressions for the lengths of 
the sides of the rectangle in terms of that variable; then write an 
equation that says its perimeter is 15, and solve for x. From that 
you can find the area.

If you need more help, please write back and show me how far you got.
