Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

In the 24-hour clock (used by the military and in Europe), there are
still 60 minutes in an hour. 3:30 pm is 15:30. 

However, if you want to express the minutes as a percentage of an hour
(30 min = 0.50 hours, etc.), then divide the minutes by 60 to get a
decimal value of the fraction of the hour.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
