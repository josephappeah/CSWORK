Hi Dr. B,

But the later Romans (as opposed to the 'ancient' ones) used M?

The Egyptians and the Hebrews, at least, were not European, so those
don't seem inconsistent with the statement.  Certainly the Greeks were
using something other than Roman numerals before the advent of the
Roman Empire, but what about afterwards?

If you'd like to identify particular passages and rewrite them so that
they're more correct, I'd be happy to update the archives.  We're
mostly mathematicians, not historians.

Which sounds like they didn't do _symbolic_ arithmetic, i.e., by
manipulating written symbols, which is what we commonly think of as
'doing arithmetic' today.  Which might be all that was intended by the
item you were criticizing earlier.

Well, you do, kind of.  :^D

Accuracy is important; but to put things in perspective, incorrect
beliefs about things like how the Romans represented 100,000, or the
ways in which they may have counted on their fingers, are somewhat
insigificant in comparison to incorrect understandings of how
fractions work, or of when and how to include units in calculations.

Computational mistakes can have grave consequences (e.g., spacecraft
crashing into planets, nuclear reactors getting out of control, oil
tankers running aground), but I honestly can't think of a situation in
which any real trouble could arise from someone believing that the
Egyptians invented helicopters, or from someone using one Roman
notation for 100,000 in place of a more appropriate one.  
 
If you _can_ think of such a situation, it would be great if you'd
submit this question to Ask Dr. Math, 

  Hi Dr. Math,

  We keep having to learn about stuff like Roman numerals
  in our math classes, but I don't understand why it's worth
  learning.  Apart from getting a bad grade, what's the worst
  that could happen to me if I just decide to ignore Roman
  numerals entirely?

and then compose an answer to it.  Be sure to mark it "Consider for
archiving" when you're done.

As I said, if you'd like to identify particular passages and send me
corrected versions, I'd be happy to include them in the site.
