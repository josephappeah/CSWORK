Hi Kjell,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The first thing to do is to find the
points of intersection of the curves.  At each point, compute the
slopes of the tangent lines to each curve, and show that the two 
tangent lines are perpendicular.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
