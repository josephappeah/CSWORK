Your description does not specify a unique octagon. Even if I make 
some assumptions about symmetry, I can't give a single answer.

I will suppose that the top and bottom sides are horizontal and the 
left and right sides are vertical. (This is not necessarily the case, 
but it probably looks better than a less symmetrical frame.) Even 
with this assumption, it is still possible to choose any angle for 
ABC = FED = EFG = BAH. The angles BCD = CDE = FGH = GHA are all equal 
to 270 degrees minus the other angle. (The external angles are 
complementary: they add to 90 degrees.) For example:

        A------------B
       / 110      110 \
      /                \
     H 160          160 C
     |                  |  external angles are 70 and 20 degrees
     |                  |
     G 160          160 D
      \                /
       \ 110      110 /
        F------------E

           A------------B
         / 135        135 \
       /                    \
     H 135                135 C
     |                        |  external angles are all 45 degrees
     |                        |
     G 15                135 D
       \                    /
         \ 135        135 /
           F------------E
