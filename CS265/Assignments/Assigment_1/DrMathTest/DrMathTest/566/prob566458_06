When I put your positions into my spreadsheet, I get 119.0223599 
degrees.

The problem with the formula you copied is not that a parenthesis is 
missing at the end, but that "arctan(" should be removed from the 
beginning. The arctangent is taken later, in the various "then" 
clauses. I will notify our archivist to correct the entry.
