If you want to generalize the problem, I would just use more 
variables, turning the ratios and the time interval into parameters 
of the problem:

  The son is now p times his father's age; in t years, he will be
  q times his father's age. How old are they now?

The solution is then

  Father now: x
  Son now: px
  Father in t years: x+t
  Son in t years: px+t

  px + t = q(x + t)

  (p-q)x = (q-1)t

      1-q
  x = --- t
      q-p

But I don't see the connection between this and object-oriented 
programming.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
