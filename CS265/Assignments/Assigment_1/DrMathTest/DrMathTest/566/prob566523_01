Hi Wilson,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The circumference of a circle is a
LINEAR function of the diameter: if C is the circumference and D the
diameter of a circle, then

   C = pi*D .

If we increase the diameter by d, so that the new diameter is 
D' = D+d, then the new circumference C' will be

   C' = pi*D'
      = pi*(D+d)
      = pi*D + pi*d
      = C + pi*d .

The difference between the new and old circumferences is 

   C' - C = pi*d .

Note that this formula depends ONLY on d, the CHANGE in the diameter,
not on the size of the diameter.

Compare this to the area. The original area is

   A = pi*(D/2)^2     since the radius is D/2
     = pi*D^2/4 .

The new area, after increasing the diameter to D' = D + d, is

   A' = pi((D+d)/2)^2

             (D^2 + 2D*d + d^2)
      = pi * ------------------
                      4

        pi*D^2   pi*D*d   pi*d^2
      = ------ + ------ + ------
           4        2        4     

             pi*D*d   pi*d^2
      =  A + ------ + ------   ,
                2        4    
      
so the change in area due to a change in diameter of size d is


            pi*D*d   pi*d^2
   A' - A = ------ + ------
               2        4      ,

so the change in area has a formula which depends on BOTH D and d,
the (original) size of the diameter, as well as the change in the
diameter.

If you have any questions, please write back and I 
will try to explain further.
