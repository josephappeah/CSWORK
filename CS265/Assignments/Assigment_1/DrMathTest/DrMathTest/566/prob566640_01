Hi Nina,

I'd call them 'one'.  :^D

You can also call them 'improper', although that includes any fraction
whose denominator isn't larger than its numerator, e.g., 7/5, 214/9,
and so on. 

In the past, I've called these 'unitary fractions', although some
people seem to confuse that with 'unit fraction' (i.e., a fraction
whose numerator is 1, e.g., 1/3 or 1/7).  

If you know of a different name for them, we'd love to hear what it is.
