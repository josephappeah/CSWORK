Hi Sajid,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  An even number is a number which is a
multiple of 2.  That is, if there is an integer n such that

  2*n

is your number, then your number is even.  Otherwise it is odd.  For
example,

  2*5 = 10

and

  2*(-7) = -14

are both even numbers, as is

  2*0 = 0,

but 1 is not an even number, because there is no integer n such that

  2*n = 1.

Does that make sense?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
