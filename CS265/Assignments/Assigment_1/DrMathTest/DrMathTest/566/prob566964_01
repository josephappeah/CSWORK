Hi,

Hire an automobile expert. There's not enough information here without
detailed information about the specific car. Simple equations aren't
going to prove anything. They are simple because they make a lot of
simplifying assumptions that are _close_ to the real world but not
accurate. More complex equations require detailed knowledge. Only an
expert who knows the physical specs of your car can prove anything to
a court of law.
