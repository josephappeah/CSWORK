Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Think about the binary number system. Each digit is a '0' or a '1'. We
can represent _any_ number using it.

For example, the binary number: 0000101 = 5 (base 10).

Think of each box as a binary digit. The first box has 1 marble. The
second box has 2 marble. The third box has 4 marbles and so on. You
can get up to 256 marbles in the 9th box. 

Do you see how this system works?
