Hi Sam,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The sumbol in question is a capital
Greek letter "delta".  The notation "/\x" (as you write it) is
read "delta x", and it simply means a change in x, usually understood
to be a small change in x.  If x is some particular value of the
variable, the point on the graph of f(x) with abscissa x is (x,f(x)).
Suppose we change x by a small amount /\x, from x to x+/\x.  Then
the corresponding point on the graph is (x+/\x,f(x+/\x)).

The expression it asks you to evaluate is the slope of the line 
through the two points (x,f(x)) and (x+/\x,f(x+/\x)).

The first expression (on the left) is wrong; the second is correct,
but you haven't substituted to evaluate the expression f(x+/\x).
[(x+/\x)^3 is NOT x^3 + /\x !]

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
