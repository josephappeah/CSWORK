The question asks how long it takes EACH PIPE to fill the pool alone. 
Thus you do need to give TWO answers: the time it takes for the first 
pipe, and the time it takes for the second pipe. Your friend's answer 
is wrong at least for this reason, that it is incomplete; I don't 
know what the answer means. (It should also have units.)

Your friend's work has three variables and two equations -- not 
enough to get an answer, as it stands, but it's pretty close. I 
suppose x and y are rates for the two pipes and t is the time it 
takes for the first (faster) pipe to fill the pool.

Let's back up a bit. What is a rate for this problem? What units 
should it have? The rates will be volumes per unit time. Then the 
product of a rate and time will be a volume. But we don't know the 
volume of the pool, so what should xt, for instance, equal? Here is a 
useful trick. We can make up our own unit of volume -- the natural 
choice is the volume of the pool. One "pool" is the volume of the 
pool, so the pool has a volume of 1 pool.

Now, we can say that x is the filling rate of the first pipe, in 
pools per hour. The product of x and t, the time it takes to fill the 
pool, is 1 pool. Now we've got an equation

  xt = 1

You can turn your friend's two equations into three equations in this 
way. Then you've got enough equations to solve for the three 
variables. Just be aware that the answer requires two numbers, and 
they are NOT the values of two of these three variables.
