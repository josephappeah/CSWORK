Hi Nia,

You mean

   2        c    c
  a b + (-3) - (--) ?
                ab

The first thing to note is that when we put two variables together, like 

  ab

it's just a shorthand for multiplication:

  ab = a*b = a times b

So we can put the multiplication signs back in to make things clearer:

   2         c    c
  a *b + (-3) - (---) 
                 a*b
  
So far, so good?  Since we're told that a = 2, we can replace 'a' with
'2' wherever we see it:

   2         c    c
  2 *b + (-3) - (---) 
                 2*b

A good next step would be to expand the first exponent:

   2
  2  = 2*2 

which gives us 

              c    c
  2*2*b + (-3) - (---) 
                  2*b

If you're not sure how I expanded it, look at 

  Properties of Exponents

If you do the same kind of substitution for the values of b and c,
you'll end up with an arithmetic expression to evaluate.  Try it, and
let me know what you come up with, okay?
