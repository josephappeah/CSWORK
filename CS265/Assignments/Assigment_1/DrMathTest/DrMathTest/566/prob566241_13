we don't have an easy way of doing this.  The most common way for
us to examine a diagram is for you to post it on some website, and
then give us the URL.

For a hexagonal prism with known dimensions like this, we probably
don't want to use a packing factor such as 74%.  We should actually
try to fit the balls in (at least using geometry) and compute the
volume directly.
