Hi Russ,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The number

   225
  4

has 136 digits when you write it all out.  Do you really want to
calculate all of that?  Maybe you can answer your question about that
number without multiplying it all out.  Hint:  You can probably answer
your question about that number by asking the same question about

      2   3   4
  4, 4 , 4 , 4 , and so on,

and then noticing a pattern.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
