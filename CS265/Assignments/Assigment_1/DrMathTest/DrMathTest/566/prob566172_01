Hi Peter,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I'm not totally sure what you're
asking, but I think it might be:  Why does it work with angle d and
not with angle c?  I also wasn't sure whether angle b was taken with
the y axis or the x axis.  For this first part, I assumed it was with
the x axis.

The reason is that the slope of a line is rise over run, or

          change in y values
  slope = ------------------
          change in x values

and the tangent is opposite / adjacent.  That means that the angle you
need to take the tangent of in order to get the slope is the angle
from the x axis (not the y axis) going to the right, up and around
counterclockwise to your line.  That's why you use angle c.  And, if
you do, then you still get

  tan a = (m1 - m2)/(1 + m1*m2)

in the second picture.

On a second read through you question, I thought you might have meant
something different.  Now I suppose that the angle b is with the y
axis, so that c = a+b makes a triangle, and you are wanting to know
how the tangent of c relates to the slope of the line l2.  For that,
notice that

  c = d + 90 degrees,

and then take the tangent.  Does that help?  You can do something
similar with the other line.

Does that answer your question?  If you have any other questions about
this or need more help, please write back and show me what you have
been able to do, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
