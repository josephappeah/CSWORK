Hi,

Almost all the logic I ever learned personally relied on a few other 
rules.  The most important of which was this:

You are allowed to make any assumption you like in a proof, as long 
as you note clearly that you are doing so.

If you assume X and derrive Y, then you have proven that (X -> Y).

Without that rule I personally cannot see a way to do your proofs.  I 
will leave this problem in the Dr. Math inbox where other members of 
the Dr. Math team can look at it and maybe help you out.
