Hi Teresa,
Thanks for writing to Dr. Math!

Sequence or pattern problems can sometimes be very challenging or 
fairly easy.  This is a matter of perspective and depends how many 
problems like this you've been exposed to.  The more you do and see, 
the less challenging these types of problems become.

I'll tell you how I approach a problem like this. 

First thing is that I know there is a pattern, so that is my goal, to 
find the pattern.

I might see if there is a pattern using addition.  

          1, 8, 27, 64, __, __, 
           \/ \/  \/  \/  \/
           +7 +19 +37  ?   ?

Hmmm, I don't see any pattern using addition.  

Next, I might try to use multiplication.  

The question is:  Is there a number that I can multiply each term by 
to get the next term?  
To get from 1 to 8, there is only one number that I can multiply 1 by 
to get 8--it's 8.  
But I also notice that I can't multiply 8 by any other number to get 
exactly 27 (no remainder).

            1, 8, 27, 64, __, __, 
             \/ \/  \/  \/  \/
             *8  *?

So far, I don't see a pattern with using addition from term to term 
and I don't see a number that I can multiply each term by to get the 
next.  

Now, I'm going to look at the positions of each numbers, sometimes 
this will reveal a pattern.  1 is in the 1st position, 8 is in the 
2nd position, ...(see below)

            1,   8,   27,   64,   __,   __, 
            |    |     |     |     |     |
            1    2     3     4     5     6  

I might ask, 
Does 1 have anything to do with 1?
Does 8 have anything to do with 2?
Does 27 have anything to do with 3?
Does 64 have anything to do with 4?

This might go somewhere!

1 is a divisor of 1.
2 is a divisor of 8.
3 is a divisor of 27.
4 is a divisor of 64.

So maybe multiplication will work, but not in the way I tried above!  
I'm going to factor each term in the sequence to look at the divisors.
1:     1     =      1
8:  (4 * 2)  = (2 * 2 * 2)
27: (9 * 3)  = (3 * 3 * 3)
64: (16 * 4) = (4 * 4 * 4)  

The 4s could be factored further, but I'm starting to see a pattern 
emerge, so I'll keep it as (4 * 4 * 4).

If this pattern continues, can you find the 5th and 6th term of the 
sequence? (I rewrote the 1s to match the pattern.)

1  =  (1 * 1 * 1)  
8  =  (2 * 2 * 2)
27 =  (3 * 3 * 3)
64 =  (4 * 4 * 4)
?  =  (? * ? * ?)
?  =  (? * ? * ?)



Does this help?
Please write back if you need anything else.
