I'm not sure what you are asking, since ordered pairs can't be 
multiplied at all (unless you mean scalar or vector products of 
vectors).

But the rationale for the definition of multiplication of complex 
numbers is that it fits what you expect from the distributive 
property and the fact that i^2 = -1:

  (a+bi)(c+di) = ac + adi + bci + bidi

               = ac + adi + bci - bd

               = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
