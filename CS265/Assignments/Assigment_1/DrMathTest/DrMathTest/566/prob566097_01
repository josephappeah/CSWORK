Thanks for showing your working. I can't see exactly what you are 
thinking as you do the problems, though. Why does the variable 
disappear in the second step each time? In the first problem, it 
appears that you just forgot about the y, and subtracted 2 from each 
side. In the second problem, though, if you did this you wouldn't get 
4 on the right side.

Here is what you should do on the first problem: -2 + y = 2. You want 
to get y alone on one side of the equation. To get the left side as 
it is, starting from y alone, you would add -2 to it. To get it back 
to y alone, you have to undo this step -- that is, subtract -2 from 
it. This is the same as adding 2. To get an equivalent equation when 
you add 2 to the left side, you must also add 2 to the right side:

  -2 + y = 2
  -2 + y + 2 = 2 + 2

The left side can be rearranged to y + -2 + 2. You can add in any 
order, so we can add -2 + 2 first, getting zero; and y + 0 = 0. Thus 
we have

  y = 4

By adding 2 to each side, we got y alone on the left, as we wanted. 
On the right we get the solution: y must be equal to 4 in order to 
make the equation true.

We should then CHECK OUR ANSWER by replacing y with 4 in the original 
equation:

  -2 + y = 2
  -2 + 4 = 2
       2 = 2

Yes, it's true when y = 4: each side of the equation equals 2. We got 
the right answer.

Now can you try to do the second example in the same way?
