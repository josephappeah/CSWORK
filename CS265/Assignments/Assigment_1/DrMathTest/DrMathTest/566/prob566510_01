Hi Ravella,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Let's start with an easier problem and use it to work up to your 
question.

How long does it take to travel 30 kilometers at 30 km/hr?

1 hour right?  A speed of 30 km/hr means I am going 30 kilometers 
every hour.  So to go 30 kilometers will take 1 hour.

Simple enough, right?

How long does it take to travel 15 kilometers at 30 km/hr?

Well, now I am only going half as far, so it should take half as much 
time.  So 15 kilometers will take me half an hour (or 30 minutes).

Make sense?

So how do I get from x kilomters at 30 km/hr to time?  I must divide 
x by 30.

30 km divided by 30 km/hr = 1 hour

15 km divided by 30 km/hr = 1/2 hour = 30 minutes

10 km divided by 30 km/hr = 1/3 hour = 20 minutes

5 km divided by 30 km/hr = 1/6 hour = 10 minutes

3 km divided by 30 km/hr = 1/10 hour = 6 minutes

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
