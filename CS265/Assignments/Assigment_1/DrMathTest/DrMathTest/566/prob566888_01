Hello Nheri,

I'll help with two of these problems, just to get you started.

1. A rope which is 128m long is to be divided into three parts such 
that the second part is twice the first and the third part is seven 
less than the second.

Let the three parts have lengths x, y, and z.  We know

x+y+z=128
y=2x
z=y-7

2. Find three consecutive integers such that twice the first added to 
5 times the second exceeds 3 times the last by 51.

We can let the integers be x,x+1, and x+2.  Then

2x+5(x+1)-51=3(x+2)
