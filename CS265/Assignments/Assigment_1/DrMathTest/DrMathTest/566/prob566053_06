Also,

Yes, you are correct.  The simple multiplication rule will not 
apply.  Looking at the detail more closely, for example with 2 red 
and 3 blue in 2 boxes, the partitions are

     (2,0), (1,1)  RED

and  (3,0), (2,1)  BLUE

The 2 Red in top row can be in same box as 3 Blue
                                           0  "
                                           2  "
                                           1  "   

with 0 Red in the other box.  

So this gives  (RRBBB)  (0)
               (RR)     (BBB)
               (RRBB)   (B)
               (RRB)    (BB)    Total = 4 possibilities.

However when we come to (1,1) Red partition in top row, because of 
the repeated numbers we no longer get 4 possibilities, but only 2, 
namely

    (RBBB)   (R)
    (R)      (BBB)

further combinations would simply repeat the above two.  This means 
that the nature of a partition affects the way it combines with 
other colours.  Only if every partition had no multiple elements, 
like (3,3,1,1,1) if partitioning 9 into 5 parts, could a simple rule 
be established.  I have to accept the statement you quoted that the 
calculation becomes very complex.

Anyhow, thanks for pointing out my mistake.  I will look at the 
question at leisure and see if some strategy can be devised.
