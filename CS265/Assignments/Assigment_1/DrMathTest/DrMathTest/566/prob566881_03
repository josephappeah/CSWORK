On the contrary, it seems quite good to me.

That's true.  Have you asked any of them about why that's the case? 

>I decided to write about math since I hope I can 
>change the way students view math. Here are my questions:
>1.What do you think about the applications of math in daily life?

Well, the first thing I think is that one of the reasons kids _do_
hate math is that teachers are constantly trying to relate it to 'real
life', when the truth is that most people can get along quite nicely
without knowing any math beyond about 5th grade arithmetic.  

Anyone who doubts this can go to any public area in America (e.g., a 
shopping mall) and ask the people there to solve simple algebra or
geometry problems.  Almost no one will be able to do it, and yet, most
people will tell you they're doing fine without being able to do that. 

It's true that people who want to be scientists, or engineers, or
economists need to know quite a lot of math in order to pursue those
careers.  But how many people do that?  One in a thousand?  

So I think we do students a great disservice by pretending that they
need to know algebra and geometry and calculus in order to get along
in the world.  From just talking to the people around them, it's
pretty clear that this isn't true; and it means they know their
teachers are lying to them.  That creates an adversarial relationship
 between the teachers and the students; and how can anyone expect the
students to learn anything in that kind of environment? 

>2.How can you help students use the skills of math in real life?

For most people, there just aren't that many opportunities to use math
in real life. 

>3.What is good about math that you think?

>5.What is your answer if your student ask,"How can we use 
>mathematical concepts,algebra,geometry even caculus in daily life 
>effectively?" ?

I would say:  It depends on what your daily life is like.
 
>Personal questions:
>1.Do you like or love math?

Love.  But I only learned to love it after I stopped thinking of it as
a kind of tool for solving 'real world' problems, and started thinking
of it as a game.  

>2.How can you apply math into your real life?( give me some example 
>of what you did that related to math)

My real life is largely writing back to students about math, so it's
not really a fair question.  Outside of that, I think about math for
fun.  But the truth is, in my day-to-day activities, I don't have much
use for math beyond arithmetic.

Good luck with your project.  Let me know if you have other questions.
