Hi Daryl,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  There are several "formulas."  They
are called "primality tests."  First there are the "pseudoprimality
tests" which can quickly tell you if a number is NOT prime, but they
can not guarantee that a number IS prime.  The Fermat test is the
best-known of these.  The true primality tests are more complicated
(which is why you usually start by checking if the number is clearly
composite first, with a pseudoprimality test) but they can tell you
conclusively whether a number is prime.  In fact, a recent discovery
was a "polynomial-time deterministic primality test" which means that
it is "fast" by a particular technical definition of "fast."  Other
non-deterministic algorithms are more effective or more efficient, but
this one is interesting theory.  For precise descriptions of
particular primality tests, search Google for "primality test."  See
also the account on MathWorld at

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
