Hello, Lorex --

I don't see how the problem with cosh(x) can be used to solve the 
other problem....

The process for solving this problem is quite simple.  The function

  f(x) = x^3-3x+4

is a polynomial function, so it is a smooth, continuous function.  
And we know

  f(-3) = (-3)^3 - 3(-3) + 4 = -27+9+4 = -14
  f(-2) = (-2)^3 - 3(-2) + 4 = -8+6+4 = 2

The value of the function at -3 is negative and the value of the 
function at -2 is positive; because the function is continuous, it 
must have a root between -3 and -2.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
