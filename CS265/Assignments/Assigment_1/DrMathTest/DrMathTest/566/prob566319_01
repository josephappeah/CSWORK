Hi Johnny,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  What you have is called the "frustum
of a pyramid."  (It's a frustum because it doesn't go all the way to a
point.)  The formula for its volume can be found by following the link
on the page:

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
