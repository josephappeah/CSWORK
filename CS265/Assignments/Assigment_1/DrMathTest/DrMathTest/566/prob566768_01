Hi, Karen --

Another writer sent this same problem a couple of weeks ago; it is a 
good problem with a somewhat humorous answer.

The traditional approach to problems like this is to work with the 
fractions of the job each person does in an hour.  Usually we would 
start as follows:

  A = # hours it takes Alice to do the job alone
  B = # hours it takes Betty to do the job alone
  C = # hours it takes Charlie to do the job alone

Then

  1/A = fraction of job Alice does in 1 hour
  1/B = fraction of job Betty does in 1 hour
  1/C = fraction of job Charlie does in 1 hour

Then the information in the problem tells us

(1) Alice and Betty together take 2 hours to do the job, so

  1/A + 1/B = 1/2

(2) Alice and Charlie together take 3 hours to do the job, so

  1/A + 1/C = 1/3

(3) Betty and Charlie together take 6 hours to do the job, so

  1/B + 1/C = 1/6

Then we can solve for A, B, and C using these three equations.

But in many cases (this is one of them!), it is easier to define our 
variables differently:

  A = fraction of job Alice does in 1 hour
  B = fraction of job Betty does in 1 hour
  C = fraction of job Charlie does in 1 hour

Then the given information tells us

  A+B = 1/2
  A+C = 1/3
  B+C = 1/6

This system of equations is easier to solve because it doesn't have 
the fractions; of course it leads to the same solution.

Try either or both of these methods and see if you can find the 
surprising answer to the problem.  And of course write back if you 
have any further questions about any of this.
