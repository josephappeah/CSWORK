Hi Adrian,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I gather that you are given an integer
y in that range and you seek to calculate a, x, and c.  Am I right? 
In general, there is not just one solution to your problem.  For
example, for y = 65000, you can use

  65000 = 0^x + 65000 with any x
  65000 = 1^x + 64999 with any x
  65000 = 2^3 + 64992
  65000 = 67^2 + 60511

and many, many others.  (By the way, we write "a^b" to mean "a to the
power b.")  So the hard part is how to find any ONE solution. 
Unfortunately, there are numbers that CANNOT be written in the form
you want, and I can explain why:  First of all, there are 2^64
different possible y values you need to express in this way.  That's a
lot of numbers.  Well, you can only choose the a, x, and c values in

  256 * 256 * 65536

different ways (256 ways to choose the a, 256 ways to choose the x,
and 65536 ways to choose the c).  You multiply those three numbers
together, and you get

  2^32

which is smaller than 2^64 by a LOT.  Worse, not every (a, x, c)
choice will give you a different number for

  a^x + c.

As shown above, many choices will give the same number.  Also, many
other choices will give a value for y that is too big.  So there will
actually be quite a lot FEWER values y in the range 0 to 2^64 - 1 that
can be expressed as

  a^x + c

with a, x, and c in the ranges you specified.

Does that answer your question?  If you have any other questions about
this or need more help, please write back and show me what you have
been able to do, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
