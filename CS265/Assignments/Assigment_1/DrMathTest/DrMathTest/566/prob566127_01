Hi Vijay,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Start by combining the two fractions
on the left side, by writing them over a common denominator and 
adding.  Then you can simplify the resulting expression with 
trigonometric identities, and obtain the right side of the equation.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
