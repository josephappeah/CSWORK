Hi Hitesh,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I couldn't read all the funny
characters in your "integration" question, but I tried this one.  You
are correct that the thing to do is solve for x in

  2b = a + c

and then get the common difference.  That equation,

  28 = 3^{(2sin x)-1} + 3^{4-(2sin 2x)}

is a transcendental equation, and generally the only straightforward
way to solve it is by numerical methods.  But there are four solutions
in every inverval of length 2*pi, which are approximately

  x = 0.2577876 + 2*pi*integer
  x = 1.2911539 + 2*pi*integer
  x = 3.3956769 + 2*pi*integer
  x = 4.4597251 + 2*pi*integer

and each of those four gives a different answer for the fifth term of
the sequence, respectively (approximately)

  54.24903905
  47.73630675
  55.42437130
  55.88086078

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
