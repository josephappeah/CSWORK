Hi LaShandra,

A way to start answering this would be to pick some pairs of points
that _do_ have a midpoint at the origin.  For example, 

  (1,0) and (-1,0)

or

  (2,3) and (-2,-3)

and see if you can spot a pattern. 

Another way would be to use variables to represent the points, e.g., 

  (a,b) and (c,d)

and then go ahead and compute the midpoint:

   a+c  b+d
  (---, ---) = (0,0)
    2    3

What does that tell you about a, b, c, and d?
