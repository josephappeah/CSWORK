Hi Deanna,

Thanks.  So that's

  change in y:  up 1, or +1

  change in x:  left 4, or -4

Once you have those, you can compute the slope this way:

          rise   change in y    1
  slope = ---- = ----------- = --
          run    change in x   -4

If you forget whether it's rise/run or run/rise, remember that a
larger number means a steeper slope.  

Okay, so now we know the slope.  The slope-intercept form for a line
looks like this:

  y = slope*x + intercept

We know the slope is -1/4, so we can write it as

  y = (-1/4)*x + intercept

We know something else, too.  We know that (5,3) is a point on this
line, which means that 

  3 = (-1/4)*5 + intercept

Can you solve this to find the value that 'intercept' must have to
make this equation true?
