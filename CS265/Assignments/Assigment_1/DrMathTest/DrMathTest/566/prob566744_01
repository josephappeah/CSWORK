Hi, Alyssa --

Let's first look at a case where we are given the formula and we 
want to find the first few terms.  Suppose we have the formula

  t(n) = 5n+7

To find the first few terms, we substitute n=1, n=2, and n=3.  We 
find

  t(1) = 5(1)+7 = 5+7 = 12
  t(2) = 5(2)+7 = 10+7 = 17
  t(3) = 5(3)+7 = 15+7 = 22

Now let's look at how each term compares to the one before it.  
Between the first and second terms, the "+7" is the same; the 
difference is "5(2)" compared to "5(1)".  Likewise, between the 
second and third terms, the "+7" is the same; the difference is "5
(3)" compared to "5(2)".  So the difference between successive terms 
is always one more multiple of 5 -- so the difference between 
successive terms is 5.

Clearly, if we did an example with t(n)=13n-24, the difference 
between successive terms would be 13.

So the coefficient of the "n" is the difference between successive 
terms in any arithmetic sequence.  But that means that, if we have 
(for example) an arithmetic sequence with common difference 7, the 
coefficient of the "n" in the formula is 7.  So the formula is of 
the form

  t(n) = 7n+c

where c is some constant to be determined.

So let's look at a specific example.  Suppose we are given the 
sequence

  19, 26, 33, 40, 47, ...

We see the common difference is 7, so the formula is of the form

  t(n) = 7n+c

for some constant c.  To determine that constant c, we can choose 
any of the given terms -- but using the first one is probably 
easiest.  We have

  t(1) = 19

and so we can say

  t(1) = 7(1)+c = 19
         7+c = 19
           c = 12

And so the formula is

  t(n) = 7n+12

So here is a summary of the process:

(1) The formula is

  t(n) = a(n)+c

where "a" is the common difference between terms and "c" is a 
constant to be determined (see step 2).

(2) To find the value of "c", use the known value of the first terms 
of the sequence:

  t(1) = a(1)+c

One more example, very quickly, to see if you can see the process 
easily....

  38, 34, 30, 26, 22, ...

(1) The common difference is -4, so the formula is

  t(n) = -4(n)+c

(2) Use the first term to find the value of the constant c:

  t(1) = -4(1)+c = -4+c = 38
                      c = 42

So the formula is

  t(n) = -4n + 42

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
