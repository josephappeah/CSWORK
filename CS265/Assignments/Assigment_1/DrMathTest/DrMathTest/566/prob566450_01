Julie,
What you need is Gauss's formula.  The story goes that, when Gauss was
10, his teacher told his class to add up all the numbers from 1 to
100.  This was supposed to keep them occupied for a while, but Gauss
finished almost immediately.  How?  Because he figured out how to add
the for N integers for any number N:

 sum(i, 1, N) = 1 + 2 + ... + N
              = N * (N + 1) / 2

There are a couple ways to prove this, but let's just accept it. 
Here, sum(i, 1, N) means the sum of i as i goes from 1 to N.  It's
just a shorthand.

The other thing we need to know is that you can factor constants out
of sums.  So, for example, if you want to sum up the first 100
multiples of 3, you can factor out the three like this:

 sum(3i, 1, 100) = 3 * 1 + 3 * 2 * ... * 3 * 100
                 = 3 * (1 + 2 + ... + 100)
                 = 3 * sum(i, 1, 100)
                 = 3 * 100 * 101 / 2
                 = 15150

Which is exactly what you got!  You can do the same for the multiples
of two to verify your answer.

Let me know if you have any more questions about this.
