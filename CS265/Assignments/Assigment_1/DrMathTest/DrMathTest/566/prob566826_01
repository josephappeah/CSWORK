Hi Jan.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

Yes, if you multiply all of the numbers together, you can carry
along the units to find the volume as

  Volume = 37 inch x 127 inch x 12 inch = 56388 inch x inch x inch
         = 56388 cubic inches

To convert this into cubic foot, multiply this by the handy 
conversion factor of UNITY (i.e. 1.0) in the very special form:

  1 = 1 
    = 1 x 1 x 1
    = (1 ft/12 inch) x (1 ft/12 inch) x (1 ft/12 inch)
    = [1/1728] ft x ft x ft / (inch x inch x inch)
    = [1/1728] cubic ft / cubic inch

The numbers in parentheses are equal to 1, because we know that
1 ft = 12 inch.

When you multiply the volume above by the conversion factor, you
will see the units of cubic inches cancel, leaving the answer in
cubic ft.
