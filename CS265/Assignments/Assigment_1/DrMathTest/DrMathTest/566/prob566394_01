Hi Jeff,

A radian is really a ratio of two lengths.  If you draw a
circle and an angle whose vertex is at the center, the
measure of the angle in radians is the ratio of the lengh of
the arc that it cuts off to the radius of the circle.

Thus the dimensions are [length]/[length], which
cancel, leaving a dimensionless measure.

In the unit circle where you may have seen radians defined,
the denominator is 1 unit of length, so it's still a ratio.
