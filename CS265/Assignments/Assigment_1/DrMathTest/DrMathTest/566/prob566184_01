Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

NEVER assume things in a math problem if you can avoid it. Your answer
depends on the assumption that the eye exam, frames, and glass lenses
all cost the same amount. That is incorrect. 

Let's try this problem in a different way, using variables to
represent our unknowns:

     E = price of eye exam
     F = price of frames
     G = price of glass lenses
     P = price of plastic lenses

We know that plastic lenses cost 4 times as much as glass lenses, or:

      P = 4G

The price of an eye exam, frames, and glass lenses is $30, or:

    E + F + G = 30

The price of an eye exam, frames, and plastic lenses is $42, or:

    E + F + P = 42

We know two equations now:

     E + F + P = 42
     E + F + G = 30
     
We can subtract one equation from the other:

    (E + F + P) - (E + F + G) = 42 - 30
   -->                  P - G = 12

So, the difference in cost between plastic lenses and glass lenses is
$12. We already knew that. But we can use: P = 4G

          P - G = 12
         4G - G = 12
             3G = 12
              G = 4

So, glass lenses cost $4. The _difference_ in cost is 3 times the cost
of glass lenses. Plastic lenses cost 4 times as much, but if you
subtract the cost of glass lenses (find the _difference_), you get
something which is 3 times the cost of glass lenses.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
