If you check a dictionary, you'll see that "consecutive" means "one 
after another". Integers are whole numbers and their negatives. So 
consecutive integers are sets of numbers like 1, 2, 3, or -2, -1, 0, 
1, or 67, 68, 69. If you are asked for two consecutive integers, then 
you have to find two integers that differ by 1.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
