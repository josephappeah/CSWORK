Hi Jazi,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  If the pool is 5 feet deep everywhere
(doesn't have a shallow end and a deep end), then the volume of the
pool is

  5 feet * 14 feet * 31 feet = 2170 cubic feet,

and you can convert this to gallons at the following web site, by
putting "2170 cubic feet" in the box on the left and "gallons" in the
box on the right.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
