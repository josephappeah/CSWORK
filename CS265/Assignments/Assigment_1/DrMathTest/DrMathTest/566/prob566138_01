Hi Abby,

Here's a simplified description:

  http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/maspec.html

The basic idea is that if you use a magnet to bend the path of a
charged particle, the amount of force that you use, and the amount of
bending, can help you differentiate between particles with different
amounts of mass and charge.  

Does this help?
