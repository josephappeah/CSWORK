Hi Veronica,

Let's start with the relationship between multiplication and division.
 Suppose I'm looking at a picture like this:

     /\
    /  \
   +----+
   |    |
   |    |
   |    |
   +----+

I can say

  The triangle is above the rectangle.

Or I can say

  The rectangle is below the triangle.

These statements look different, but they say the same thing.   In
just the same way, suppose I have three statements that look like this:

   (1)  3 * 4 = 12       

   (2)  12 / 4 = 3

   (3)  12 / 3 = 4

These all _look_ different, but they say exactly the same thing.  

Does that make sense?  Let me know if it does, or if you find anything
about it confusing.
