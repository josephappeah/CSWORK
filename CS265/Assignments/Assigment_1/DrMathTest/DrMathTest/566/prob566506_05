Hi Greta,

Thanks for writing back to Dr. Math.

You're right that is too big.  The problem is that your surface area 
is 2122.64 square inches, but a square foot is not 12 square inches, 
it is 144 square inches.

1 square foot = 1 foot * 1 foot = 12 inches * 12 inches = 144 square 
inches

Therefore, the surface area of your ball is 2122.64/144 square feet.

Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.
