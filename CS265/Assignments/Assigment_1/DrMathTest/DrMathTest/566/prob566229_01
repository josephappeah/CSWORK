You're probably referring to what is technically called the 
"commutative property". (Both that and the associative property 
involve "order" in some sense, which is why we have technical terms; 
but some textbook authors try to keep it "simple".)

This page discusses this and other properties:

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back. It will 
help if you can show us a specific problem or two that you have 
trouble with, so we can better understand what you need.
