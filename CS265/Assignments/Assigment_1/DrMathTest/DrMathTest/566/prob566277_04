The formula doesn't change at all. If (a1,b1) are the longitude and 
latitude of the upper left corner, then you calculate (x,y) in the 
same way and measure them from the upper left corner. Thus, when a=a1 
and b=b1, you'll get x=0 and y=0 -- the upper left corner. When a=a2 
and b=b2, you'll get x=w and y=h -- the lower right corner.
