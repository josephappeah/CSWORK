Hi Shanda,

If you start by covering (1) how to find multiples of a number, and
(2) how to find factors of a number, then you've covered the subject
right there.  To find the least common multiple of two numbers, 

  a) List the multiples of each number
  b) Find the common multiples, i.e., the ones shared by both numbers
  b) The smallest common multiple is the Least Common Multiple

Basically, you want them to feel like they can look at the phrase
'least common multiple' and know that they can figure out the meaning
of the phrase from the meanings of the individual words. 

The same goes for finding the greatest common factor of two numbers:

  a) List the factors of each number
  b) Find the common factors, i.e., the ones shared by both numbers
  c) The largest common multiple is the Greatest Common Multiple

Again, what you're really doing is making sure that they understand
the individual words

  least
  greatest
  common
  multiple
  factor

You might have to cover the process by which you _find_ multiples and
factors.  Multiples are pretty straightforward:  To find the multiples
of a number, you 'count by' that number. 

To find the factors of a number, you can take the simple approach of
trying to divide the number by each smaller number:

  12 /  1 = 12          So 1 and 12 are factors.
  12 /  2 =  6          So 2 and 6 are factors.
  12 /  3 =  4          So 3 and 4 are factors.
  12 /  5 =  2 rem 2    So 5 is not a factor.
  12 /  6 =  2          So 6 and 2 are factors.
  12 /  7 =  1 rem 5    So 7 is not a factor.
  12 /  8 =  1 rem 4    So 8 is not a factor.

and so on.  If you work a few examples like this, it should occur to
your students - without your having to tell them! - that you can stop
trying factors once you get halfway to the target number.  (Do you see
why?)  

For larger numbers, like 255, this is a lot of dividing to have to do!
 So there is a simpler way to find factors, if you know what prime
numbers are, and how to find the prime factors of a number.  You can
read about that here, 

  Finding the Factors of a Number
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58525.html

but it's not necessary to be able to do this to understand what a
greatest common factor _is_, and how to find one. 

The most important thing in setting up your lesson is to focus on
understanding _what_ a least common multiple or a greatest common
factor _is_, rather than jumping right into the 'best' or 'most
efficient' way to find them.  So if they already understand what
multiples and factors are, this is a 10 minute lesson.
