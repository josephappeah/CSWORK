We get a LOT of questions about percentages; here is a page of 
answers to questions like yours:

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/sets/select/dm_percentage.html

In your case, you know 15 are NOT occupied, so 90 - 15 = 75 ARE 
occupied. The occupancy percentage is

  75
  -- * 100%
  90

(that is, the fraction that is occupied, times 100%).

If that doesn't fully answer your question, feel free to write back.
