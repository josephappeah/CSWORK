Hi Rosana,

The problem is, once you're in class it's too late to be taking notes.
 What you need to be doing is reading the book and taking notes
_before_ you get to class:

In other words, when you're sitting in class, you should pretty much
know everything the teacher is going to say before he says it.  Trust
me - this is a _lot_ more fun than trying to scribble down what he
just said a minute ago while trying to listen to what he's saying now.

The basic fact to remember is that there are 360 degrees in a circle.
 From that, you can more or less figure everything else out.  For
example, suppose you go halfway around a circle?


                *   *           
            *           *       
                                
         *                 *   
                                  
      end.........C.........start  

         *                 *

            *           *
                *   *
                
That's half a circle, so it's half of 360 degrees, which is 180
degrees.  So a straight line is a 180 degree angle:
  
     A-------B-------C              Angle ABC = 180 deg

What if you go one-fourth of the way around a circle? 

                  end
                * . *           
            *     .     *       
                  .             
         *        .        *   
                  .               
         *        C.........start  

         *                 *

            *           *
                *   *

That's one-fourth of 360 degrees, which is 90 degrees.  So a 'square
corner' (also called a 'right angle') is 90 degrees


           A
           |
           |
           |
           B--------C                 Angle ABC = 90 deg

Half of that would be one-eighth of the way around the circle, 

                  
                *   *           
            *           * end      
                        .        
         *            .    *   
                    .               
         *        C.........start  

         *                 *

            *           *
                *   *

which would be 1/8 of 360 degrees, which is 45 degrees.  

And so on.  Does this make sense?
