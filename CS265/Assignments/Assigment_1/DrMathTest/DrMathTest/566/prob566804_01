The angle whose cosine is 1/31 is the inverse cosine (or arccosine) 
of 1/31. I assume you were allowed to use a calculator in this exam, 
because I couldn't do it otherwise (well, a slide rule or math tables 
would also work).

The question is incorrect, however. The length of a nautical mile is 
fixed, just like the statute mile we use on land: it is 1852 meters 
or 6076.11549 feet. See the following page in the Dr. Math Archives:
