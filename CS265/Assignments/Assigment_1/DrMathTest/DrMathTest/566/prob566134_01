Hi Carol.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  Good start:  your first 
equation is a statement about the (known) area of the patch:

  216 = (2l)*w

     w
  +-----+
  |     |  l
  +-----+
  |     |  l
  +-----+

The other equation is a statement about fence lengths:

  total fence length T = 4l + 3w.

To get these boiled down into one equation that you can differentiate,
solve one of these equations for one variable or the other, and then
substitute the result in the other equation.  Since you will probably
want to optimize T, you will probably have to save that equation to
be differentiated.  Thus, we rearrange the first equation:

   w = 216/(2l) = 108/l

and substitute this in T to obtain

   T = 4l + 3*108/l
     = 4l + 324/l

Now we require dT/dl = 0.
