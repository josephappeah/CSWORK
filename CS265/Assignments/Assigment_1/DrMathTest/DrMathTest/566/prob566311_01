Hi Stuart.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

I think your work is correct and that 

   V = 0.021598... = 0.022 m^3

after taking into account the extra 10% volume.  

I can think of two explanations for the discrepancy:

  1.  It is a simple mistake, where they've either added the 10%
      twice, or performed the addition twice in succession.  These
      two operations are slightly different:  A + 0.1A + 0.1A = 1.2A
      and B*(1.1)*(1.1) = 1.21B.

  2.  Perhaps they meant that the extra 10% is to be done on each
      factor of the diameter, i.e. V = pi*(1.1*r)*(1.1*r)*h.  But
      the way you phrased the question ("10% of the volume") makes 
      me think that this isn't the case

I hope that these comments help.  The motion of the gas through the
pipe makes no difference as to the volume enclosed--what goes in
one end must come out the other end.
