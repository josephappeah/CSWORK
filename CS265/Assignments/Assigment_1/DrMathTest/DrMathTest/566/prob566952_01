Hello

The answer is in our archives:

Deriving Lagrange's Trig Identity
http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/64574.html

De Moivre's formula is not mentioned
as such but is used in that answer when
the author writes

e^(ikx) = cos(kx) + i*sin(kx)

which is De Moivre's formula because

(cos x + i sin x)^k = ( e^(ix) )^k = e^(ikx) 


Please feel free to ask again if
you have more questions.
