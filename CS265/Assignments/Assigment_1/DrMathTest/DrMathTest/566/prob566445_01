Hi Neil,

To find out what sin and cos mean (and how they're used), see

  Trigonometry in a Nutshell
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/53942.html

In the context of these kinds of problems, we usually 'break up' a
motion into horizontal and vertical components.  If we know that there
is an initial speed of V at some angle x to the horizontal, 

         
        /
   V   /
      /
     / o
    / x
   /_______

we can decompose that into components,

          ^
         /|
        / |
   V   /  | v_vert
      /   |
     / o  |
    / x   |
   /------>
    v_horiz

From the definitions of sin and cos, we know that

  v_horiz                   v_vert
  ------- = cos(x)          ------ = sin(x)
     V                         V

which means that


  v_horiz = V * cos(x)      v_vert = V * sin(x)

Since sin(x) and cos(x) can never be greater than 1, the component
velocities can never be greater than the total velocity. 

The basic idea in analyzing this kind of motion is this:  Gravity only
works in the vertical direction, so we can ignore the horizontal
motion while we figure out how long it would take something going
straight up with initial speed v_vert to go up and down to the final
height we're interested in.  This is the 'time of flight'. 

Once we know the time of flight, we can assume that the thing moves at
a constant horizontal speed v_horiz for that much time, which tells us
how far downrange it ends up.

Does this help?
