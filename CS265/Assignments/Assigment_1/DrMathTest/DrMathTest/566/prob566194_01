Hi Emil,

Note that time doesn't really enter into mathematics, since math is
mostly about imagination, and we can imagine processes that require
infinitely many steps but are completed in finite amounts of time. 
(We do this every time we take an integral, for instance.)

So it doesn't help to say that we wouldn't have time to construct the
set of all sets that don't contain themselves.  We can imagine that
we've constructed it (in the same way we can imagine that we've
constructed 'the set of all integers', even though we wouldn't really
have time for that, either), and when we do that, we run into a
contradiction.  It's to avoid the contradiction that the somewhat
clumsy definition of sets is constructed. 

Does this help?
