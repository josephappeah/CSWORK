Hi Kene,

I've never heard of it, so your guess is as good as mine.  Have you
considered asking the company about it? 

If you go to 

  http://www.google.com/

and search on 

  g-math

you'll find links to a number of computer packages with names similar
to that.  It might be that they want you to familiarize yourself with
one of these.
