Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

There are almost 14 million possible combinations (I leave it to you
to figure out the exact number and how to calculate it). 

If you would like a list, I would suggest writing a computer program
to do it. It would be nearly impossible for a single person to list
them all.
