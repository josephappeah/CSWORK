Hi Zac,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  "Smooth" isn't a mathematical term
like "prime" or "continuous", for which there is essentially universal
agreement about its meaning.  The term is often used to mean that a
function has some degree of differentiability, but the precise 
requirement depends upon the context.  A writer who knows that he will
never differentiate a function more than once may use "smooth" to mean
C^1, i.e. continuously differentiable, while another, who doesn't want
to bother with specifying a definite number of derivatives a function
must have may use it to mean "infinitely differentiable".  The number
of derivatives you require "smooth" to mean depends upon what you
are doing, and how many derivatives you will need to take.  If you 
want to discuss curvature, for example, then you will often need to
take second derivatives.

If you simply want to know whether you will be able to discern any
irregularity by looking at the graph, then I would doubt that you
can determine by eye whether a graph is the graph of a function which 
is C^1 (continuously differentiable) or C^2 (twice continuously
differentiable).  Look at the "cubic parabola",

          {  -x^2   x < 0
   f(x) = {   x^2   x >= 0

as an example.  The difference in "flattening" at the origin which 
makes this function have no second derivative at x=0, as opposed
to the true cubic g(x) = x^3, is on a scale which is not apparent 
to my eye.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
