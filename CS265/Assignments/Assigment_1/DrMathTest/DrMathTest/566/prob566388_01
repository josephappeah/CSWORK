Hi Alan,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The integers are all the numbers with
no fractions, including negatives, so the integers are the numbers

  .... -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...

Then the term "natural numbers" is usually given to the "positive
integers," which are

  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...

but is less often used to mean the "nonnegative integers," which are

  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

and are sometimes also called the "whole numbers."  Then there are the
"negative integers,"

  -1, -2, -3, -4, ...

and the "nonpositive integers,"

  0, -1, -2, -3, -4, ...

Now, the integers, and the four types of integers (positive,
nonnegative, negative, nonpositive) are very well-defined, and always
mean the same thing.  The term "natural number" is almost as
well-defined, but sometimes people will use the words differently. 
The term "whole number" is less well-defined, and is best avoided
since different people will interpret it differently.  Finally,
"regular number" has no agreed-upon mathematical meaning.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
