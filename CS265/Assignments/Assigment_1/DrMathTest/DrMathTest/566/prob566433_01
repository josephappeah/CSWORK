Hi Glenn,

The lowest common denominator (LCD) will be the smallest number that
is divisible by all of the denominators, i.e., the smallest number
divisible by 3, 4, 9, and 32. 

There are lots of ways to find this, but even if you don't know
anything but how to multiply, you can do this:  Start lising multiples
of each of those numbers:

   3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, ...

   4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, ...
 
   9: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, ...

  32: 32, 64, 96, 128, ...

Now, at some point, you'll find a number that will appear in all four
lists.  The smallest such number is the one you're looking for.  Do
you see why? 

Note that you can quickly get _a_ number that is divisible by all the
denominators by just multiplying them all together:

  3 * 4 * 9 * 32 = 3456

But the question is whether this is the _smallest_ such number.  One
thing you might notice is that if something is divisible by 32, it's
certainly divisible by 4; so there's really no reason to multiply by 4:

  3 * 9 * 32 = 864

Similarly, if something is divisible by 9, it's got to be divisible by
3 as well:

  9 * 32 = 288

Can you keep going this way, or is this as small as you can make it?
