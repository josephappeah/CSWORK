Hi, Sam --

You are right -- your confusion is over the "1/3 as many" wording.

Your approach is a very good one, and you chose "nice" numbers:

>The way I did the problem was by picking numbers. For the number of 
>marshmallow chewies I chose 60 and for the nut chewies I chose 120; 
>since the nut chewies are "twice as many as marshmallow delights."  

This looks fine....

But then you didn't use the "...1/3 as many..." information 
correctly:

>Then I multiplied 1/3 by 120 to get the number of cashew chewies 
and 
>got the result 40 which I subtracted from 120 and got 80 for the 
>amount of cashew chewies and 40 became the number of peanut 
chewies.  

There are two problems here.  If you multiply the 120 (nut chewies) 
by 1/3 to find the number of cashew chewies, then the number of 
peanut chewies is going to be the other 2/3 of the 120.  But 1/3 of 
120 (40) and 2/3 of 120 (80) do not satisfy the condition that one 
of the numbers is 1/3 of the other.  And you (probably 
inadvertently) switched the numbers of cashew chewies and peanut 
chewies around, so that the number of cashew chewies is more than 
the number of peanut chewies.

Note that it is easy to check your results to this point.  If you 
look at your numbers of 80 cashew chewies and 40 peanut chewies, you 
can see that the number of cashew chewies is twice the number of 
peanut chewies, whereas it is supposed to be 1/3 as much -- so you 
know you have made an error somewhere.

Then your final step is okay...:

>After that for the probability formula I plugged in 80 for the 
>desired outcome and 120+60= 180 for the number of possible 
outcomes.  

The "120+60" is correct for the number of possible outcomes; 
however, as noted in the previous paragraph, the "80" is not correct 
for the number of cashew chewies.

So if you fix your arithmetic so that the 120 nut chewies are 
divided into two groups with 1/3 as many cashew chewies as peanut 
chewies, then you should get the right answer.

While choosing specific numbers is often a good approach, I usually 
try an algebraic approach first to see if it doesn't get too messy.  
Here is how I would solve this problem:

(1) There are twice as many nut chewies as marshmallow delights.

Okay...  x = marshmallow delights; 2x = nut chewies

(2) The nut chewies are either peanut or cashew and there are 1/3 as 
many cashew chewies as there are peanut chewies.

I avoid fractions whenever possible, so I read this as there being 3 
times as many peanut chewies as cashew chewies:  y = cashew chewies; 
3y = peanut chewies

Now I have a total of y+3y = 4y nut chewies.  And from (1) I know 
the number of marshmallow delights is half that, so I have 2y 
marshmallow delights.

So altogether I have 4y+2y=6y candies; and of those, y are cashew 
chewies.  So the probability that I will choose a cashew chewy is

  y/6y = 1/6

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
