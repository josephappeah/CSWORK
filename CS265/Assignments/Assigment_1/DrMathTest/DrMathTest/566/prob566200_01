Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Knowing just the angles is insufficient.

For example, consider two triangles:

Triangle 1: Lengths of sides: 3-4-5

Triangle 2: Lengths of sides: 6-8-10

Both triangles have the same angles, but the lengths of their sides is
different. So, without knowing the length of any side (or the
perimeter or area or something else), you cannot figure out the length
of any of the sides.
