Hi Robert,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  How many pegs are removed at each
move?  How many pegs will be left at the end?  So how many moves is that?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
