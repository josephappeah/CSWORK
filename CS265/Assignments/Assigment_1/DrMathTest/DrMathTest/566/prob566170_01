Hi Mel,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  you are supposed to use properties
of exponents in this problem, such as

 a^(b+c) = a^b * a^c  , a^(b-c) = a^b / a^c , and  (a^b)^c = a^(b*c).

Using these properties, can you rewrite 2^3x+2 in terms of 2^x, the
quantity whose value you know?  

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
