Hi, Vivian --

Presumably the ground is flat, and both poles are vertical -- if we 
don't assume this, then we can't solve the problem.

Assuming those things, the wire, the poles, and the ground form two 
right triangles.  The posts are 25 feet apart -- so if the stake is 
x feet from the 8-foot post, then it is (25-x) feet from the 12-foot 
post.  The legs of one of the two right triangles are 8 and x; the 
legs of the other are 12 and (25-x).  We can use the Pythagorean 
Theorem to find expressions for the lengths of the hypotenuses of 
the triangles; the total length of the guy wire is the sum of those 
two hypotenuses.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
