Hi Natalie,

>40% of $100 = $40.00

Note that if you mark something down _to_ 40%, the new price is 40% of
the original, which is what you've got here.  If you mark something
down _by_ 40%, you eliminate 40% of the original price, leaving 60%. 
So if the dress originally has a cost of C dollars, the sale price is

  60% of C = 0.60 * C

>60% of $40.00 = $24.00

Same sort of deal here:  If you reduce the sale price by 60%, you have
40% of the price remaining.  So the final price is

  40% of (0.60 * C) = 0.40 * 0.60 * C

Does this make sense?
