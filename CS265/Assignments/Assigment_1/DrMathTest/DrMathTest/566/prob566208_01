I'm not sure where you got your sample equation -- what is S, and 
where does the 30 comes from? I'd think S would be the selling 
price, but then your equation doesn't make sense.

The selling price is the cost plus 45% of the COST, not of the 
selling price:

  S = C + 0.45C = 1.45C

Then

  C = S/1.45

tells you the cost that would yield the given selling price.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
