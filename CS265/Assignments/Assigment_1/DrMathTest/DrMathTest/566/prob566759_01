Hi Adrian,

On almost all of these so-called "work problems" the best approach
is to convert the problem to jobs.  In this case, the job is filling
the pool.

Figure out how much of the job can be done by each person in
some amount of time.  I will use 1 minute as the amount of time.

In one minute,

Jim can do 1/30 of the job
Sue can do 1/45 of the job
Tony can do 1/90 of the job

If they're working together, in one minute they can do:

1/30 + 1/45 + 1/90 of the job, which is:

3/90 + 2/90 + 1/90 = 6/90 = 1/15 of the job

Thus the entire job takes 15 minutes with all of them working.
