Hi Danny,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The definition of a homogeneous 
function is given at

  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HomogeneousFunction.html .

The term xy is homogeneous of degree 2, because (cx)(cy) = c^2 xy 
A polynomial is homogeneous of degree n if every term has total 
degree n, i.e. the sum of the degrees of all the variables is n.

If you have any questions, please write back and I will try to 
explain further.
