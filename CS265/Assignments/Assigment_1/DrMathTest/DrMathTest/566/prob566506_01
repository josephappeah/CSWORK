Hi Greta,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The surface area of a sphere is 4*pi*(radius^2).

The radius of your ball is 13 inches.  13^2 = 169.

Multiply by 4pi and you get 2124 square inches.

You can find formulas like that here:

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
