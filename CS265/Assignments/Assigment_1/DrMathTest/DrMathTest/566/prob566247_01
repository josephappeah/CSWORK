Hi,

I'm not sure what you're asking.  If the sphere is sitting _on_ the
cone, the total height will just be the height of the cone plus the
diameter of the sphere.  If the sphere sinks down as far at is can
(absorbing the cone, if necessary) then the total height is the height
of the sphere or the height of the cone, whichever is greater. 

If the sphere can sink part-way onto the cone, then you'd need more
information to solve the problem. 

Or have I misunderstood your question?
