Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

1 full tank of gas is 8/8 of the tank. If the car is run until there
is 1/8 tank left, the motorist has used:

   8/8 - 1/8 = 7/8 tank

So, if the motorist topped off the gas tank with 14 gallons, the 7/8
of a tank used must have been 14 galloons. In other words:

   1/8 tank + 14 gallons = 1 full tank
              14 gallons = 1 full tank - 1/8 tank
                         = 7/8 tank

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
