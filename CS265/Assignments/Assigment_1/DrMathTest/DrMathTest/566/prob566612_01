Hi, Kelly --

This kind of problem is one commonly found in an algebra class, 
because it lends itself very nicely to a solution using some basic 
algebra concepts.  But I don't know if, as a 7th grader, you have 
been introduced to basic algebra yet.

I will go ahead and describe the traditional algebraic solution; but 
then I will suggest a different solution which only uses methods 
which should be familiar to a typical 7th grader.

The key to the algebraic approach is to write an equation showing 
the amount of actual alcohol in the various parts of the problem.  
We start with 20cc of 50% alcohol solution; that means we have 10cc 
of actual alcohol.  (50% of 20cc = .50 * 20cc = 20cc.)  Then we add 
some number "x" of cc's of 100% alchol -- which is of course "x" 
cc's of actual alcohol -- and we end up with "20+x" cc's of an 80% 
alcohol solution, which contains (.80 * (20+x)) cc's of actual 
alcohol.  So we have

  .50(20) + 1.00(x) = .80(20+x)
  10 + x = 16 + .8x
  .2x = 6
  x = 30

So the number of cc's of pure alcohol we need to add is 30.

But of course that solution will be hard for you to follow if you 
haven't yet studied algebra....

So here is a different approach, using ratios.  Let's think about  
what happens when we mix a 50% alcohol solution and a 100% alcohol 
(i.e., pure alcohol) solution.

If we mix the two ingredients in equal parts, then the percentage in 
the resulting solution will be halfway between the 50% and 100% of 
the two ingredients -- it will be 75%.  Another way to think of that 
case is that the two ingredients are mixed in the ratio 1:1.  This 
ratio of 1:1 in this example is indicated by the fact that the 
differences between the percentage of the mixture and the 
percentages of the two ingredients are in the ratio 1:1.  That is, 
the percentages of the ingredients were 50% and 100%, and the 
percentage of the mixture was 75%.  100-75 = 25 and 75-50 = 25; 
these two differences are equal -- that is, they are in the ratio 
1:1.  The differences in percentages are in the ratio 1:1 because 
the ingredients were mixed in the ratio 1:1.

In our problem, we don't want a 75% alcohol solution, as we would 
get if we mixed the ingredients in the ratio 1:1.  We want an 80% 
alcohol solution.  Note this means that more than half of our 
mixture will be pure alcohol -- so the answer is going to have to be 
more than 20cc.

If our desired percentage is 80% and the percentages of the 
ingredients are 50% and 100%, the difference between those 
percentages are 30% and 20% respectively (80-50=30; 100-80=20).  
These differences in percentages are in the ratio 30:20 or 3:2.  
This means our two ingredients must be mixed in the ratio 3:2, with 
the larger portion being the pure alcohol we are adding.

So we need 3 parts of pure alcohol to 2 parts of the original 
solution.  If the 2 parts of original solution is 20cc, the 3 parts 
of pure alcohol we need is 30cc.  This is, of course, the same 
answer we got using the traditional algebraic approach -- but we 
didn't have to use algebra in this method of solution.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
