Hi Rita,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Let

  x = 2m - 7n

and substitute that into your equation.  Then solve for x.  Does that
help?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
