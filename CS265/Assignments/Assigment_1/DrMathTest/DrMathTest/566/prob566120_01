Hi Meron,

More precisely, acceleration is the _change_ in velocity with respect
to time.

The thing is, we don't measure velocity directly.  We can measure
acceleration by measuring forces; and we can measure position
directly. We compute velocities.  So it's not clear what it would mean
to 'measure' velocity with respect to distance.

Mathematically, it's just an inverse relationship, and there's no
difference between this equation and the equation

  z = xy

Physically, it means that if you know any two of Force, mass, and
acceleration for a given system, you can solve for the third.
