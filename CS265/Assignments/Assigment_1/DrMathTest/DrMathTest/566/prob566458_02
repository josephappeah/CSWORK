It is easy for me to miss a follow-up question in the barrage of 
questions we get each day. That is why the e-mails you get from us 
(like this one) include a link to use for submitting follow-up 
questions. If you will use that link, your question will be directed 
specifically to me and I am sure to see it.

The web site from which I got the formula used the opposite 
convention for longitude: west is positive. We can check whether I 
corrected it or not by choosing a simple case. For example, let 
lat1=lat2=0, lon1=0, and lon2=1 degree. If the standard convention 
(east is positive) is used, we should get a bearing of 90 degrees 
(east). What do we get?

  y = - sin(lon1-lon2)*cos(lat2)
    = - sin(-1)*cos(0)
    = -sin(-1)
    = sin(1)

  x = cos(lat1)*sin(lat2)-sin(lat1)*cos(lat2)*cos(lon1 - lon2)
    = cos(0)*sin(0)-sin(0)*cos(0)*cos(-1)
    = 0

The arctangent of the angle from the x axis to the vector (0,sin(1)) 
is 90 degrees. Thus the negative sign in the formula for y corrects 
for the longitude sign, so that east longitudes are positive. You 
could also write

  y = sin(lon2-lon1)*cos(lat2)

If you don't have an atan2() function, you can use the algorithm 
found here:

  Bearing Between Two Points
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55417.html

  dlat = lat2 - lat1
  dlon = lon2 - lon1
  y = arctan(sin(lon2-lon1)*cos(lat2)
  x = (cos(lat1)*sin(lat2)-sin(lat1)*cos(lat2)*cos(lon1-lon2))
  if dlat > 0 then
    if dlon > 0 then tc1 = 90 - arctan(y/x)
    if dlon < 0 then tc1 = 270 + arctan(y/x)
    if dlon = 0 then tc1 = 0
  if dlat < 0 then
    if dlon > 0 then tc1 = 90 + arctan(y/x)
    if dlon < 0 then tc1 = 270 - arctan(y/x)
    if dlon = 0 then tc1 = 180
  if dlat = 0 then
    if dlon > 0 then tc1 = 90
    if dlon < 0 then tc1 = 270
    if dlon = 0 then point 1 = point 2

I made the correction to the formula for y so east longitudes are 
positive.
