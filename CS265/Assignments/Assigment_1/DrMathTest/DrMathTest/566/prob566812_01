If the original price was P then we must increase P by 15% to reach 
a value $97.98

To increase something by 15% we multiply by 1.15

So we have the equation

     1.15P = 97.98

              97.98
         P = -------  =  $85.20
               1.15

So the original price was $85.20

To find the original price the final value must be divided by 1.15 
if markup is 15%.
