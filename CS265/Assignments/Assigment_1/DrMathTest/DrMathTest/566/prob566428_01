Hi Toni,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

>sixteen and thirty four hundredths
>16.34       is that right

Yes, that is correct.

>i don't get the eleven-ten thousandths...

Write the fraction as

      11
    -----
    10000   .

To convert this number to a decimal, you can use the following
observation.  When you divide a number by 10, you shift its 
decimal point one place to the left; when you divide by 100,
you shift two places to the left; and so on.  The number of
places to shift is the same as the number of zeros in the
denominator you are dividing by (when the denominator is a
1 followed by a number of zeros).

10000 has four zeros, so you shift the decimal point in 11
(or 11. ) four places to the left:

   .0011.

Nine and eleven ten-thousandths is then 9.0011 .

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
