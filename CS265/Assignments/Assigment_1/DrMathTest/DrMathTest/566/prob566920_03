Hi, Lauryn --

There are a lot of ways you might go about finding this formula on 
your own, depending on your mathematical background.

Assuming that you know the formula for the sum of the first k 
integers:

                k(k+1)
  1+2+3+...+k = ------
                   2

then here is a way you can find the formula for your problem.

(1) Place the first point on the line; we can't draw any line 
segments using just one point:

  f(1) = 0

(2) Place the second point on the line; now we can draw exactly one 
segment, joining the two points:

  f(2) = 1

(3) Place the third point on the line; now, in addition to the 1 
segment we already had with just 2 points, we can draw 2 other line 
segments -- 1 each from the previously existing two points to the 
new point:

  f(3) = f(1)+2 = 1+2 = 3

(4) Place the fourth point on the line; now, in addition to the 3 
segment we already had with just 3 points, we can draw 3 other line 
segments -- 1 each from the previously existing three points to the 
new point:

  f(4) = f(3)+3 = 1+2+3 = 6

(5) Place the fifth point on the line; now, in addition to the 6 
segment we already had with just 4 points, we can draw 4 other line 
segments -- 1 each from the previously existing four points to the 
new point:

  f(5) = f(4)+4 = 1+2+3+4 = 10

You should be able to see the patterns here: when we add the n-th 
point, we create (n-1) new segments; and the total number of 
segments with n points is

  1+2+3+4+...+(n-1)

This sum, according to our formula for the first k integers, is

                      (n-1)(n-1+1)   n(n-1)
  1+2+3+4+...+(n-1) = ------------ = ------
                            2           2

I hope this helps....
