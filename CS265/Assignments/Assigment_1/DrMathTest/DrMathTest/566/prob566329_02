Hi Daniel,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You should use logarithms to answer
this question:  The logarithm to base b (think b=10, which is called
the "common logarithm" and written on your calculator as "log") will
tell you how many digits a number has.  (Round down to the nearest
integer, then add one.)  To get the highest digits, take the
fractional part of your logarithm, and then take the "antilogarithm,"
which is 10 raised to the fraction.

For example, 12345678 gives

  log 12345678 = 7.0915149455092...

and you'll notice that it has 8 digits, and

  10^(0.0915149455092) = 1.2345678000...

Finally, remember the number one rule for logarithms:

  log (a^b) = b*(log a).

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
