Typically when I answer questions about this, I point out that in 
real life we just say "four point three two ..." rather than what is 
taught in schools:

  Multi-Digit Decimal Numbers
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/59180.html

But legal documents would be one case I'm not thinking of when I say 
that.

Here are the answers to your examples:

  .05       = 5 hundredths
  2.50      = two and fifty hundredths
  4.3221412 = four and three million, two hundred twenty-one
              thousand, four hundred twelve ten-millionths
  5.2822    = five and two thousand, eight hundred twenty-two
              ten-thousandths

On the page referred to above, I briefly explain the process. The 
idea is to write a fraction using 1 as the denominator, then move 
the decimal point in both numbers until the numerator is whole; then 
read the resulting fraction:

  0.3 221 412    3,221,412
  ----------- = ----------
  1.0 000 000   10,000,000

Because there are seven decimal places in the given number, the 
denominator is 1 followed by seven zeroes, or ten million.

See this page for the general issue of writing the names of 
fractions (and how to hyphenate them):
