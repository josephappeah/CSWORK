Hi George,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I'm not sure I understood what you
meant by "go in turn."  Did you mean:  You have ten cards, with ten
numbers, and you want to choose four of them so that you don't get any
cards with adjacent numbers?  So that

  1 3 5 7

and

  2 4 7 10

would be two different ways, but

  1 3 4 9

would not be counted.  And I suppose that 1 and 10 should not be
counted as adjacent or "in turn," right?  Finally, the order in which
you choose the 4 cards should not be considered, right?  Only which
four you get.

Please write back and tell me if I understood you correctly, and then
I'll help you answer the question.
