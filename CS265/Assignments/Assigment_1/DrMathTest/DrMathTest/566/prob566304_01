>(12), so 12 is an abundant number.

It is probably better to avoid using the word "aliquot"; I don't 
know that I've ever used it in my life. Perhaps the source that used 
the word in its definition of "abundant number" also gave a 
definition of "aliquot"; that is the proper procedure whenever one 
uses a term that is used in different ways depending on context.

See this page for confirmation of the ambiguity you have found:
