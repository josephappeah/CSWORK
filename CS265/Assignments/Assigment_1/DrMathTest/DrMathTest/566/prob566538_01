Hi Alex,

The mathematics behind string theory is very complex and difficult.  
Some of the areas of math that string theory (and other areas of 
theoretical physics) use are real and complex analysis, group 
theory, topology, and differential geometry among others.

Most of the discoveries with respect to the mathematics have been 
known for a long time, it's only recently that physicists have found 
applications for them.  This is actually a very common practive in 
the history of mathematics and science.  The theory behind matrix 
algrebra was well-established long before Planck (or maybe Bohr) 
applied it to quantum mechanics.  Now probablity theory is used 
instead of matrix theory since it makes the problems easier--but the 
probablity is even older than the matrix algebra!

Does this answer your questions?
