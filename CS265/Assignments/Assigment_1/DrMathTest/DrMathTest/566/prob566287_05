It's easier to see what you did wrong if you show me what you did 
(not just the answer).

You're trying to simplify

       2x          1           8
  ------------ - ----- - ------------
  x^2 - 6x + 9   x + 1   x^2 - 2x - 3

The answer CAN'T be just a polynomial! There has to be something in 
the denominator. Maybe because I answered the question you asked 
(how to solve an equation) rather than what you meant (how to 
simplify an expression), you followed my instructions too literally. 
Remember, you can't just multiply an expression by something and 
still have an equivalent expression. To simplify, you have to find a 
common denominator and multiply BOTH numerator and denominator by 
the same thing, in order to make an equivalent fraction with the 
common denominator, and then add them all.

Please show me what common denominator you chose, and what the three 
numerators were when you converted the fractions.
