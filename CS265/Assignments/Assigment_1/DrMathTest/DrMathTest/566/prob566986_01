Are you using yourself as an example of a person who is difficult to 
convince of the statements made in that article? As stated there, it 
is mathematically impossible to trisect an angle using only a compass 
and straightedge. If you claim to have done so, you must still be 
misunderstanding what it means in some way.

There are at least three more common sources of misunderstanding that 
are not mentioned in that article:

1. It is impossible to devise a method that can trisect ANY angle. It 
is possible, for instance, to trisect a 90-degree angle (that is, to 
construct a 30-degree angle) using only compass and straightedge. But 
if you are given any arbitrarily constructed angle, no method using 
compass and straightedge alone can ALWAYS construct an angle 1/3 the 
size of that given angle, whatever the angle is.

2. The construction must be EXACT. There are methods that produce 
very good approximations to 1/3 of the given angle, and there are 
methods that could continue improving the approximation by an 
iterative process so that you can get as close as you need to be, 
given enough steps in the construction. But the goal of the Greeks' 
effort to trisect an angle was to produce an angle that could be 
mathematically proven to be EXACTLY 1/3 of the given angle.

3. Following on the second point, the mathematical PROOF is critical. 
The concept of exactness does not apply to any real-world 
construction or measurement; nothing can be measured precisely enough 
to confirm that it is mathematically exact. So when we speak of 
constructing with a compass and straightedge, we don't really mean a 
physical compass and physical straightedge. We mean the application 
of mathematical theorems equivalent to these devices, but operating 
in the "perfect world" of mathematical thought.

Following up on what the article said, I don't think there is any 
reason for a teacher to bring up this subject except in the context 
of discussing the world of rigorous mathematical proof using 
definitions, postulates and theorems. In any other context it is 
misleading and confusing. In this context it can get students' 
attention and inspire the kind of questioning that leads to real 
learning.
