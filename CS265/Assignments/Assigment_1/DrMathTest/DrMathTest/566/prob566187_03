You can find the centers of the circles by constructing the
perpendicular bisectors of two chords and finding their
intersection.  From there it's easy to find the radii.

Also, the point P I mentioned in the last message is really
a center of projection of which the tangent points are
one pair.  If you can find any other pair that are in the
same projection, you can connect them and they will
cross at P.

Here's one way to do that.  Construct perpendiculars to the
line connecting the centers and connect the two
points on opposite sides of the center line where the
perpendiculars intersect the two circles.  This will also
be point P.  Once you know P, construct a tanget to one
circle through P and it will be tangent to the other.
