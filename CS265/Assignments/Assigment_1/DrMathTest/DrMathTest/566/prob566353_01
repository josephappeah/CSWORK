Hi Khyati,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Of unit area or unit radius?  You said
unit area (which would imply radius 1/sqrt(pi)), but then you said
area = pi (implying radius 1).

Assuming radius 1/sqrt(pi), it looks like the answer is 7.  An upper
bound would clearly be 9, by area considerations, but there is no way
that you can fill *all* of the area with smaller circles.  Can you lay
down 7 circles inside the big one?  The hard part is proving that 8 is
impossible.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
