Hi Jenn,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  If you use the suggested typing
conventions, your problem would be written

   log_7(49^5) ,

the logarithm to the base 7 of the fifth power of 49.

You need to use properties of logarithms: see

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55522.html

and use property (3').

The archived answer also explains what logarithms mean, so that
you should be able to find the value of

   log_7(49) .

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
