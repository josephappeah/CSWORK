Hi Jim,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It looks like the differences form an
arithmetic progression:

  298 - 209 = 89
  209 - 129 = 80
  129 - 58  = 71
  58 - (-4) = 62

so this would be called a "quadratic progression."  Does that help?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
