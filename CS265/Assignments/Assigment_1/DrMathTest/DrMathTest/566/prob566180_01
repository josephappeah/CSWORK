Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

If Pupil 47 is opposite Pupil 16, then Pupil 46 is opposite Pupil 15. 

Pupil 45 is opposite Pupil 14.
Pupil 44 is opposite Pupil 13.
Pupil 43 is opposite Pupil 12.
Pupil 42 is opposite Pupil 11.
Pupil 41 is opposite Pupil 10.
And so on until:
Pupil 32 is opposite Pupil 1.

So, half the class is Pupils 1 to 31. The other half of the class must
also have 31 students. So, how many students are there?

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
