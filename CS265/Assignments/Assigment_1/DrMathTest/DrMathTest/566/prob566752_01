Hi Michael,

You can never get a perfect fit, even for the tiniest part of the sphere,
assuming the paper doesn't stretch.  But you can get as close as you
want if you make small enough pieces.  A good approximation to
a sphere can be achieved in many ways, but a nice method might
be to do it as a sort of geodesic dome, like those created by
Buckminster Fuller.

Here's a website that will tell you how to build a dome like that
to live in, but you can give the "dome calculator" any dimensions
you want, and it'll show you what sizes to make the approximating
triangles for some very close approximations:

    www.desertdomes.com

That's the home page with a general description, but there are
links on that page to the dome calculator and various other items
that might be of interest.

A "2V" or a "3V" dome ought to be enough for you.  The "1V" is simply
an icosahedron.
