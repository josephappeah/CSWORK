Hi Sandy,

Let's look at something simpler, but along the same lines.  Suppose I
ask you to subtract

  (5 dollars and 6 dimes) - (3 dollars and 2 dimes)

You could subtract the dollars and dimes separately, right?

    (5 dollars and 6 dimes) - (3 dollars and 2 dimes)
 
  = (5 dollars - 3 dollars) + (6 dimes - 2 dimes)

  = 2 dollars and 4 dimes

Does that make sense?  What if the number of dimes is higher in the
amount being subtracted?

    (5 dollars and 2 dimes) - (3 dollars and 6 dimes)

  = (5 dollars - 3 dollars) + (2 dimes - 6 dimes)

Uh oh!  Fortunately, we can avoid this situation by 'making change':

    (5 dollars and 2 dimes) - (3 dollars and 6 dimes)

  = (4 dollars and 12 dimes) - (3 dollars and 6 dimes)

  = (4 dollars - 3 dollars) - (12 dimes - 6 dimes)

  = 1 dollar and 6 dimes

So far, so good?  If so, note that your problem is the same as this,
except you have feet and inches instead of dollars and dimes; and when
you 'break' a foot, you get 12 inches (where 'breaking' a dollar gives
you 10 dimes).

With this in mind, take another shot at your problem, and let me know
what you come up with.
