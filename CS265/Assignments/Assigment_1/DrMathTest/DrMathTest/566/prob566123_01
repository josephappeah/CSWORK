Hi Widodo,

The usual way to present something is to start by explaining that
there is something people want to do, which can't currently be done,
or can only be done in a clumsy or inefficient way (providing an
example of that).  Then you show that your 'new' way of doing it is
superior to that.  

In short, what is it that we'd like to be able to do, but can't do
without using your expansion?
