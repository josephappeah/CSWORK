Hi Jill,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  That's a good question.  You are
correct that the definition of "scalar" is left rather vague, and
that's because it can mean different things at different times.  For
example, sometimes mathematicians talk about complex vector spaces
(such as putting a matrix in Jordon form, which sometimes requires
complex numbers), and yet the complex numbers are a two-dimensional
vector space over the real numbers.  So in the first example, the
complex numbers are the scalars, but in the second example, the
complex numbers are vectors, and the real numbers are the scalars. 
And those aren't the only types of scalars possible.  For example, the
real numbers are an infinite-dimensional vector space over the
(scalars of) rational numbers.

So you see, it depends on what you are talking about.  A careful
mathematician will always clearly state, as some say, where his (or
her) variables live.  That means that he will say that what type of
numbers he is considering to be scalar - usually by saying something
like "over the reals."  Then the dimensions are built on the scalars.

In other words, the definitions of dimensions and scalar (in linear
spaces) are inter-related.  They go together, and so they need to be
defined together.  But the definition can change from one text or
chapter or theorem to another, and so good mathematicians should
define the terms before using them, as well as each time they change
what they mean by them.

Does that clear things up any?  Or is that only worse?  If you have
any questions about this or need more help, please write back, and I
will try to offer further suggestions.
