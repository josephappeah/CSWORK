I direct you to the site we have used for many such formulas: Ed 
Williams' Aviation Formulary.

  http://williams.best.vwh.net/avform.htm

Click on "Intersection of two radials." I have not looked over his 
formula at all, but he has been reliable in regard to other formulas. 
Remember, though, that his formulas use the backward convention for 
longitude, that west longitudes are positive.
