Hi again,

I forgot to point out that we have a symbolic logic webpage which 
teaches you the basics of logic and shows several examples and rules 
for derrivation.  The page is:

  A Crash Course in Symbolic Logic
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/symbolic_logic.html

Hopefully you will find it helpful in answering your questions.  If 
any other problems are tricky, I'd be happy to help you with them.
