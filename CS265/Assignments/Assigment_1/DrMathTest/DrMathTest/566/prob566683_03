Hi John,

There's a difference between 'doing' something in school, and actually
having learned it.  Lots of kids get into algebra, for example, having
'done' fractions, but they really have no idea what a fraction is.  So
they don't realize, for example, that 

  x^3   x*x*x   x   x   x
  --- = ----- = - * - * - = 1 * 1 * x = x
  x^2     x*x   x   x   1

or that you can do this simplification without knowing what the value
of x is, or that it works even if x isn't an integer.  

They've memorized some rules (like "to divide by a fraction, invert
and multiply") and some simplified models ("a fraction is when you cut
something into some number of pieces, and keep some of them") without
really _understanding_ any of it, so as soon as a problem asks them to
go anywhere they haven't been before, they have no idea what to do. 

Everything about subtraction and negative numbers can be figured out
by someone who actually _understands_ arithmetic with positive
numbers.  But if someone has merely been memorizing procedures, the
most you can do is ask her to memorize more procedures.  Eventually,
they start getting mixed up in her head, and when this happens, she
can't really get any farther in math.  

Here's an example of what I mean by 'understanding'.  We probably get
100 questions a month like this:  "If some quantity is increased by
20% and the result is 150, what's the original amount?"  The
questioner usually knows how to increase 150 by 20%:

  150 * 1.20 = ?

But he doesn't know how to do the inverse:

  ? * 1.20 = 150

So here's the thing.  If you actually understand division, you know
that it's not just a procedure that you can do involving lots of
guessing and borrowing.  You know that it's the inverse of
multiplication, i.e., all of the following

  3 * 4 = 12        12 / 3 = 4       12 / 4 = 3

are just different ways of stating exactly the same fact.  So whenever
you see something that looks like one of these, you can change it to
one of the other forms if that's more convenient.  So if you see
something like 

  ? * 1.20 = 150

you can change it to

         ? = 150 / 1.20

and what's the fuss?  So even though you're supposed to be tutoring
her in 'algebra', you'll be doing her a huge favor if you can get her
caught up on basic arithmetic, starting with addition and
multiplication, and then explaining subtraction and division in terms
of inverses.  It looks like she's already reached the limit of how
much she can memorize.
