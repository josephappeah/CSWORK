Hi Bobby,

It's not so much that we 'need' them, as that having defined numbers
and arithmetic, they turn out to exist as a consequence of the
definitions. 

That is, from integers and division we can define rational numbers;
and we can show that certain numbers (like the number you need to
square to end up with 2) can't possibly be rational.  Therefore, they
have to be irrational, whether we like it or not. 

Does this make sense?
