Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The probability that the 8th flip will be heads is 50%. 50% is only
for a _single_ flip. The probability that all 8 flips will be heads is
(1/2)^8 = 1/256. It's 50% for all the flips, and you multiply
probabilities if you repeat trials:

   (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/256

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
