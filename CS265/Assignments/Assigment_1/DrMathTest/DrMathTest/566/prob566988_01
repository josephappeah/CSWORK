Hi Anna,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Let

   L = lim f(x)
       x->A


Suppose L < 0.  Then for any positive epsilon (E), you can choose
a delta (D) such that if 0 < |x-A| < D, then

   |f(x) - L| < E.

Can you choose an E such that if |f(x) - L| < E, then f(x) < 0?

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
