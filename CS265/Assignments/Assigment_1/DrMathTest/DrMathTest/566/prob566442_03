Hi India,

Do you mean to find the prime factors of the large numbers, e.g., 

  21458793 = ? * ? * ... * ?

There's no easy way to do that.  You can use divisibility rules, like
the ones in our FAQ, to test for divisibility by various numbers.  For
example, by adding up the digits of the number above, 

  (2 + 1) + (4 + 5) + (8 + 7) + 9 + 3 

I see that the sum is divisible by 3; and that tells me that the whole
number is divisible by 3.  So I can write

  21458793 = 3 * 7152931

I can try the same thing on 7152931, but it's not divisible by 3. 
Trying other primes, it's not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19. 
But is _is_ divisible by 23:

  21458793 = 3 * 23 * 310997

Now we can keep trying other primes, up to the square root of 310997.
 But we won't find any, because it's prime.    

Trying the same thing with the other number, 

  14757842 = 2 * 11 * 670811

So in this case, there's no way to simplify the ratio.  

But the short answer to your question (if your question is "How do I
find the prime factors of a large number?") is that there isn't an
easy way to do it.  It's _because_ there's no easy way to do it that
very large prime numbers are useful for encryption. 

Does this help?
