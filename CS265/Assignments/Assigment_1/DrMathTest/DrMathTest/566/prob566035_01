Hi Elif,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Will you please clarify what you mean?
 Because the only function I know of that is called "arg" takes a
complex number and returns a real number (the angle from 0 in the
complex plane).  So if you mean to treat x as a real variable and find
a real derivative, then the arg is always 0 and so the derivative is
zero.  If you mean to treat x as a complex variable, then there is no
derivative, because the arg function is not analytic.  So you must be
talking about some other function, and I'm not sure which one.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
