Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Average velocity is found by finding the distance traveled and
dividing it by the time traveled. You have the total amount of time.
Now, you need to find the total distance traveled.

1) How far does the truck travel while accelerating from rest to 25
m/s^2 at 2.1 m/s/s?

2) How far does the truck travel while travelling at 25 m/s for 25s?

3) How far does the truck travel while decelerating from 25 m/s to
rest in 3.5 s?

Can you work these figures out? You can figure them out separately and
add them together.
