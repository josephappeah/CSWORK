Hi Hayley,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

1 foot = 12 inches

So 2 feet must be twice as many inches:

2 feet = 2 * 12 inches = 24 inches

So 3 feet must be three times as many inches as 1 foot:

3 feet = 3 * 12 inches = ?

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
