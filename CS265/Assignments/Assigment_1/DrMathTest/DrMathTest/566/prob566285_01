Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

If you take any number, scramble the digits, and subtract the smaller
from the larger, the result is always divisible by 9. It's not too
difficult to show this is true.

One property of multiples of 9 is that the sum of their digits is also
divisible by 9. So, if the result is 40185, and you select 1, the sum
of the remaining digits is 17. From there, it is a matter of knowing
that 18 is the next multiple of 9 from 17 and outputting 1. Notice
that you are not allowed to select 0. If you were allowed to select 0,
the program could not tell if you had selected 0 or 9, since neither
will affect the sum (modulo 9). 

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
