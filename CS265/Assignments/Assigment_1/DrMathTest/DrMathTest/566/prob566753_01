Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

An isocohedron is a 20 faced polyhedron (think of something like a
soccer ball). An icosagon is a 20 sided polygon. Neither is really
going to describe the 3-D shape of the house. However, the perimeter
of the house is going to form an icosagon, not an isocohedron (which
is 3 dimensional). 

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
