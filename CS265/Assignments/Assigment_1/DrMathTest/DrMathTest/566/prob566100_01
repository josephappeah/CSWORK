Hi Kurt,

Different people have different opinions about what math 'is'.  Here's
mine:

  What is Mathematics?
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52350.html

Why is there math?  In a word, 'curiosity'.  We have math for the same
reason we have other kinds of games - because people like to make up
problems and then figure out how to solve them.  

It's true that math is abstract.  There are some people who would
argue, in fact, that math is 'the science of abstraction', which is
just a fancy way of saying that mathematics is about spotting and
describing patterns. 

But abstraction is something that brains do naturally.  For example,
when you see a kind of dog that you've never seen before, but
recognize it as a 'dog', your brain is performing an abstraction.  All
you're learning to do in math is become a little more aware of what
your brain does naturally, so you can become a little more efficient
at it.  

Can you give me an example of something you find 'too abstract'? 
Maybe I can help you look at it in a way that will be less confusing
to you.
