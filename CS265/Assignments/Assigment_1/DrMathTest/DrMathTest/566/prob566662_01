Hi Klebert,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  If I'm not mistaken, this symbol is
context-dependent, meaning that it does not have a commonly
agreed-upon meaning but rather is used by different methematicians to
mean different things, and so a good mathematician should state what
he intends the symbol to mean before he uses it.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
