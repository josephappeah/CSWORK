Hi Kerri,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You haven't clearly indicated what
the problem is.  What is F(x)?  How is it related to f(x)?  I would 
guess that
           x
          /
   F(x) = | f(t) dt ,
          /
          0

but I don't want to spend time on what might be the wrong problem.

Please resubmit your problem, explaining precisely what each function
is and what you are trying to prove.
