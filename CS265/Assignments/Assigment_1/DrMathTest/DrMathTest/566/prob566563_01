We discuss this kind of question in our FAQ:

  Large numbers and infinity
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.large.numbers.html

(See links for pages about really large numbers.)

"Zillion" is not a real number, but just a humorous word for "a lot". 
The next special name after "trillion" is "quadrillion".

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
