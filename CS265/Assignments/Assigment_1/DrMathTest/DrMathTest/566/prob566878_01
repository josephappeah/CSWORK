Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Debo!

Take an equilateral triangle whose vertices have rational
coordinates.  First show that the slopes of all three sides are
rational (or infinite!).  Pick two adjacent sides with finite
slopes m and M.  Then the angle between them X will have tangent
given by

   tan(X) = (m-M)/(1+m*M),

which is rational.  But the angle between then is Pi/3 radians
or 60 degrees, whose tangent is sqrt(3), an irrational number.
Contradiction!

You fill in all the details and reasons.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
