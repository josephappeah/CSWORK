Hi Debbie,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The car has

  dC(t) = 0 + 0*t + (1/2)(2.46 m/s^2)*t^2

and the truck has

  dT(t) = 0 + (17.9 m/s)*t + (1/2)*0*t^2

and first you need to find out the time when

  dC(t) = dT(t).

Then use that to get the distance.  (Also:  There are two solutions in
t to that equation.  Can you explain what both of them mean?)

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
