Hi Fleming.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

Hint:  The experimental outcomes are

  1 A and B
  2 A only 
  3 B only
  4 neither A nor B

All four of these outcomes are mutually exclusive--one and only
one of these outcomes must occur.

From the first statement we know that

  Pr(A) = Pr(1) + Pr(2) = Pr(1) + Pr(3) = Pr(B)

You can obviously infer that Pr(2) = Pr(3) from this.

From the "either" statement, we know that

  Pr(1) + Pr(2) + Pr(3) = 0.70.

You finish.
