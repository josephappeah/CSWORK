Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Think of it as a regular coin flip problem. What is the probability
that if you flip a coin twice, it will be heads twice or tails twice?
The answer is 1/2. If the flips are HH or TT, the flips repeated. The
same thing applies here:

Any sequence of 4 flips is likely for the first 4 flips. The next four
flips can occur in any of 16 ways. So, the chance that 2 occur back to
back in 8 flips is 1/16.

(1/16)(1/16) is the probability that a _particular_ sequence (say
htth) repeats. But 1/16 is the probability that _any_ sequence of 4
flips repeats.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
