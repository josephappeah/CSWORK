The questions you are asking were a problem for the ancient Greeks, 
too. They assumed that all numbers were "commensurable" -- that any 
two numbers could be expressed as whole-number multiples of the same 
quantity (however small that quantity might be in a particular case). 
Then the Pythagoreans proved that the hypotenuse of an isosceles 
right triangle is incommensurable with the equal legs -- in other 
words, that the square root of 2 is irrational. This threw them for a 
loop, but they eventually had to accept it.

How about you -- does it bother you that a triangle with angles of 
45, 45, and 90 degrees must have at least one side that has an 
irrational length? It seems to me that this is the same problem as 
the one you raise about circles. But it's much easier to prove that 
the square root of 2 is irrational than it is for pi, so it will be 
helpful if you can settle the triangle question in your mind; then 
the circle question won't be an issue.
