Hi Roseanne,

Let's say Wendy chooses to count by w's, and Gina chooses to count by
g's.  For sure, there will be at least one number they'll both say:

  g*w = w*g

Do you see why?  If they count forever, they'll also say all the
multiples of this number:

  1*(g*w), 2*(g*w), 3*(g*w), ...

So you're looking for two numbers, g and w, such that when you
multiply them together, you get something that's more than half of
100.  (Otherwise, they'll agree on both g*w and 2*g*w.)  

This narrows things down considerably.  They have to choose different
numbers, to the only possible pairs are

  6*9, 7*8, 7*9, 8*9
    
Of course, if they choose numbers with a common factor, e.g., 6 and 8,
then they'll agree before they get to 6*8:

  6, 12, 18, 24, ...
  8, 16, 24, ...            24 is less than 6*8

So they need to choose numbers that have no common factors.  

Let's recap:  You need to find two numbers, w and g, such that w and g
have no common factors, and w*g is more than 50.  

Does this help?
