Hi Peter,

>(product1-product2)/product2

If the basis of comparison is product 2, then you need to have that in
the denominator.

>faster than product2” and the second calculation gives us the

>slower than product1”.

See above.  The first calculation is comparing product 2 to product 1,
i.e., saying that the difference in speed is some percentages of the
speed of product 1.  

The second calculation is comparing product 1 to product 2, i.e.,
saying that the difference in speed is some percentage of the speed of
product 2.  

Does this help?
