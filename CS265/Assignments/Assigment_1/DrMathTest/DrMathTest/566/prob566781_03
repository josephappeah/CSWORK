Hi, Sam --

This confuses even many people who are good at math.

Take your 120 chewies and take 1/3 of them; you get 40, leaving 80 
others.  The 40 is not 1/3 of 80 -- it is 1/2 of 80.  The reason 
this didn't give you  the correct result is that, when you take 1/3 
of the 120, you leave 2/3 of the 120 -- and 1/3 is half as much as 
2/3, not 1/3 of it.  In order for the number of cashew chewies to be 
1/3 the number of peanut chewies, you need to divide the whole 
number of chewies into two fractions whose sum is 1 and in which the 
smaller fraction is 1/3 as big as the larger fraction -- and those 
two fractions are 1/4 and 3/4, not 1/3 and 2/3.

This confusion with fractions is another reason why I said in my 
original response that I avoid using fractions whenever possible -- 
because there are so many things about them that can be confusing.  
So when I see that there are 1/3 as many cashew chewies as peanut 
chewies, I re-phrase that to say that there are 3 times as many 
peanut chewies as cashew chewies.  So then if the number of cashew 
chewies is x, the number of peanut chewies is 3x.  Together that 
makes a total of x+3x=4x chewies, which is the total of 120 
chewies.  So

  4x = 120
   x = 30
  3x = 90

And we see that there are 30 cashew chewies and 90 peanut chewies.

I hope this helps clear things up.  Of course write back if you 
still have questions.
