Hi MesiNesi,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  There *is* a fast way.  Let me explain
how it comes about.  Let's suppose that you have a number that is a
terminating decimal, such as

  x = 23.56452

Then then is some power of 10 that you can multiply it by to get an
integer, right?

  10^5 * x = 2356452

So then x is the fraction

  x = 2356452/100000

of course, now you can eliminate common factors from the numerator and
denominator (like 2) to put x in simplest form.

So let's recap:  If we have a number whose decimal form terminates,
then it can be written as an integer divided by a power of 10.  When
you eliminate common factors to put the number in simplest form, then
the denominator will still have no other primes factors besides
(possibly) 2 and 5.

So if you have a fraction in simplest form whose denominator is
divisible by some prime *other* than 2 or 5, then it will *not*
terminate.  On the other hand, if you have a fraction whose denominator is

  2^a * 5^b,

then you can multiply the numerator and denominator by

  2^(b-a)

or

  5^(a-b),

depending on whether a or b is greater, and now you have the number
written as an integer divided by a power of 10, and it is clearly a
terminating decimal.

So how do you decide if the denominator is only divisible by the
primes 2 and 5?  Well, you could factor it, but that can sometimes by
very time consuming.  But you don't have to factor it.  If the number
is even (look at the last digit), then divide by 2.  Repeat until the
number is odd.  Now if the number is divisible by 5 (if the last digit
is 5), then divide by 5.  Repeat until the number is not divisible by
5.  If you end up with 1, then the number will terminate.  If you end
up with anything else, then the number will repeat.

In your examples, all four of them repeat.  None terminate.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
