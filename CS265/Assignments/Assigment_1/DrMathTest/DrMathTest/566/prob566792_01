Hi, Edward --

You can, at least temporarily, ignore the negative sign on the 
common ratio.  And you don't really need to get into logs for this 
problem.  The use of logarithms can be useful and often necessary 
when we have a general geometric series with a "weird" common 
ratio.  But in cases where the common ratio is "nice", we usually 
don't need to use logs.

In this example, we simply have

  A(n) = A(1)r^(n-1)

or

  A(n)/A(1) = r^(n-1)

  704/11 = r^(n-1)

  64 = r^(n-1)

We know

  64 = 2^6
  64 = (-2)^6
  64 = 4^3

Any of these potentially provides a solution to the problem; 
inspection of the second term in the series tells us that the common 
ratio is -2, and so

  n-1 = 6
  n = 7

Of course, all of this is really a long way around the problem 
anyway.  Inspection of the first two terms shows us the common ratio 
to be -2, so we simply solve

  A(n) = A(1)r^(n-1)
  704 = 11*(-2)^n-1
  ...

to find the value of n.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
