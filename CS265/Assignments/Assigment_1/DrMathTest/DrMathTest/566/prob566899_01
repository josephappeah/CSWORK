Hi David,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  This is a very complicted but very
important example, since it shows that many "intuitive" properties
of differentiation are not true.

Above, you state that

>I have determined that lim x-->0 g'(0) = 0.

That is not correct.  The point of this problem is to show that this
limit does not exist, but the function is differentiable at x=0 
anyway.  [This is a point that many people don't understand: a 
function can be differentiable at every point of an interval, but not
be continuously differentiable - i.e. the derivative function need 
not be continuous.]

>Am I correct in concluding that the limits do not exist because the 
>tend to two different values? 

No.  The one-sided limits do not exist.  This is quite different from
the nonexistence of a "two-sided" limit because the two one-sided 
limits, each of which exists at a point, have different limiting 
values, as at a jump discontinuity.  There is another type of 
discontinuity, sometimes called an "oscillatory" discontinuity.
The function values never 'settle" down, but rather just keep
oscillating through an interval of values.

In your pfd file, you answer (a) by "direct substitution".  I don't
know what you mean by that.  You seem to be saying that since g(0)
is defined by the second line of the piecewise definition, that
lim g(x) = g(0) = 0.
x->0

However, that is not correct.  A function f need not be defined at 
x=a in order to have a limit 

   lim f(x)
  x->a 

and even if f(a) is defined, its value is irrelevant to the existence
of this limit.  For this function g(x), the key idea is that

   |g(x)| <= |x|^2 .

You can either use the "Squeeze Theorem", or just argue directly with
epsilons and deltas, to show that

 lim g(x) = 0  , which incidentally is g(0), so g is continuous at 0.
 x->0

I don't understand your answer to (b).  You first say that the two
one sided limits exist and are equal everywhere, including x=0, and
then you say "with the exception of the point x=0", which contradicts
your first statement.

sin(1/x) is a composite function, and h(x) = 1/x is continuous for
all x =/= 0  (x not equal to 0), while the outer function sin(y) is
continuous for all y, so by the theorem on continuity of composite
functions, sin(1/x) is continuous for all x=/=0.  This function is
multiplied by x^2, which is also continuous for all x, so the product
function is continuous for all x=/=0 by the theorem on continuity of
product functions.  Therefore, g(x) is continuous for all x=/=0 by
general theorems, and your result in a handles x=0, so that g is 
continuous for all x.

Your answer to (c) is more complicated than necessary, since once
again, general theorems about the differentiability of composite and
product functions tell you that g is differentiable for all x=/=0,
so the only issue is at x=0, and you only have to look at

       g(x) - g(0)
   lim ----------- = lim  x sin(1/x)
  x->0    x - 0      x->0

which can be analyzed by the Squeeze Theorem (or directly).

Your computation in (d) is correct.

You are correct that (in the usual extended sense)

        1                    1
   lim  - = +oo   and   lim  - = -oo ,
  x->0+ x              x->0- x

but then you incorrectly transfer these results to g'(x).  It is
not true that

   lim  g'(x) = +oo    or   lim  g'(x) = -oo  .
  x->0+                    x->0-

Your formula

   g'(x) = 2xsin(1/x) - cos(1/x)

in fact shows that neither one-sided limit exists.  If 1/x is an
even multiple of pi,

   1                     1
   - = 2*k*pi, or x = ------ , then sin(1/x) = 0 and cos(1/x) = 1,
   x                  2*k*pi

while if 1/x is an odd multiple of pi,

   1                           1
   - = (2*k+1)*pi, or x = ---------- , 
   x                      (2*k+1)*pi

then sin(1/x) = 0 and cos(1/x) = -1.

There are such points in every interval (-D,D), and this fact
violates the Cauchy criterion, so g'(x) cannot have a limit as
x->0 (or even x->0+ or x->0-).

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
