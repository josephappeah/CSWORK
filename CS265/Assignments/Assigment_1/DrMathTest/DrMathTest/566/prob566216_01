Hello, Yvonne --

Assuming that the formula is valid and your measurements are 
correct, then you calculations are correct also.  And since the 
result of those calculations is unreasonable, we must conclude that 
either the formula or the measurements -- or both -- are incorrect.

The formula seems to be believable.  The common ants with which I am 
familiar typically are capable of moving 1 or 2 cm per second, which 
according to the formula corresponds to temperatures of 18 to 33 
degrees Celsius, which is around 60 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

Your measurements seem to be impossible.  I have never seen an ant 
move at an average rate of 14 cm per second.  As I noted above, my 
experience shows the common small black ant to move at only 1 or 2 
cm per second at the most.  And even the big black forest ants I 
have seen only move at perhaps 4-5 cm per second at the most.  
Perhaps your measurement was in fact 82mm -- or 8.2cm -- in 5.87 
seconds, instead of 82cm in that time.  Those measurements, used in 
the given formula, would provide a reasonable value for the 
temperature.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
