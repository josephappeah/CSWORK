Hi Saba,

Good job finding that pattern! The reason is that the sum of the 
digits of ANY multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 9. Since you keep 
adding the digits (each time getting a new multiple of 9, but 
smaller multiple however), eventually you'll end up with a single 
digit number. Think about it: the multiples keep getting smaller and
smaller, so eventually you'll get to the multiple 9 itself.

Now, how do I know that the sum of the digits is always
a multiple of 9? Suppose that a number N has digits a,b,c,d,...
(from right to left),

 N = a + 10b + 100c + 1000d + ...
   = a + (b + 9b) + (c + 99c) + (d + 999d) + ...
   = (a + b + c + d + ...) + (9b + 99c + 999d + ...)
   = (a + b + c + d + ...) + 9*(b + 11c + 111d + ...)
 N = (sum of digits of N) + 9 * (some number)

Now, look at that equation carefully. It means that

 (sum of digits of N) = N - 9 * (some number)

Since N is assumed to be a multiple of 9, we can write it
in terms of another integer k, so that N = 9k

   (sum of digits of N) = 9 * k  -  9 * (some number)
                        = 9 * (k - (some number))
                        = 9 * (some other number)

Since we showed that the sum of the digits is 9 times
some integer, then it is also a multiple of 9 itself.

The summary is this: starting from a multiple of 9, you keep adding
the digits, each time arriving to a multiple of 9. This establishes
a chain of decreasing multiples of 9, until eventually you reach 9
(from a two-digit multiple). Does that make sense?

It doesn't work for other integers because the chain is broken.
For example, multiples of 8 such as 56 don't add up to a multiple
of 8. 

Well, I hope this helped!

Let us know if you have any more questions.
