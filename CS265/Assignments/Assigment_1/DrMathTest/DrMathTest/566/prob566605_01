Hi, Jeremiah --

You can't look at the differences in times or rates separately; you 
need to look at them together.  It is a bit difficult to see how to 
do that in this problem because we don't have absolute times -- we 
only have a difference in times.  (Actually, the way the problem is 
presented, we don't even have that; we need to read between the 
lines to infer that if one train is 10 minutes late and the other is 
16 minutes late, then the difference between the travel time for the 
two trains is 6 minutes.)

You are surely familiar with the relationship

  distance = rate * time

and the equivalent

  rate = distance/time
  time = distance/rate

These relationships between absolute measurements are also valid for 
differences in measurements.  For example

  distance1 - distance2 = rate * (time1 - time2)

(With a constant rate, the difference in distances is that rate 
times the difference in the times.)

  distance1 - distance2 = time * (rate1 - rate2)

(With a constant time, the difference in distances is that time 
times the difference in the rates.)

  time1 - time2 = distance1/rate - distance2/rate

(With a constant rate, the difference in times is the difference of 
the two distances divided by that common rate.)

  time1 - time2 = distance/rate1 - distance/rate2

(With a constant distance, the difference in times is the difference 
between that common distance divided by the two rates.

We can use this last equation to solve our problem.  For our 
problem, we know the two distances are the same; we know the two 
rates; and we know the difference in the times.  So we know all the 
values in this last equation except the distance -- so we can put 
those numbers in and find the distance.  We need to watch our units; 
since the rates are in mph, we need to change our known time 
difference of 6 minutes to hours.  We get

   1    d    d
  -- = -- - --
  10   30   40

  12 = 4d - 3d

  12 = d

The two towns are 12 miles apart.  Checking this answer, the times 
required to travel 12 miles at 30mph and 40mph are

  12mi    12      24
  ----- = -- hr = -- hr = 24 minutes
  30mph   30      60

and

  12mi    12      18
  ----- = -- hr = -- hr = 18 minutes
  40mph   40      60

The difference between these two times is 6 minutes, as required.

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
