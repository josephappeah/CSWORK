I'm not 100% sure what you're asking.  It seems to me that you're
asking whether or not phi (the golden ratio) is irrational.  To
explore this, we can look at one of the many characterizations of phi.
 One way to define phi is that phi equals phi plus 1.  We can write
this mathematically as:

 phi^2 = phi + 1

You can then solve this equation using the quadratic formula.  If you
do, you'll get an expression which includes the square root of 5.  The
square root of 5 is known to be irrational so phi must also be irrational.

I recommend you solve the quadratic equation above to prove this to
yourself.  You'll find that there are two solutions to the equation
(both of which are irrational).  The golden ratio is the positive root.

Let me know if you have any more questions about the golden ratio.
