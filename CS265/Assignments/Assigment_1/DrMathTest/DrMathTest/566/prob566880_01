Hello, Caio --

Obviously, you can't show anything like this by using valid 
mathematical methods.  But you can show things like this by using 
invalid methods, as shown on the following page in the Dr. Math FAQs:

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.false.proof.html

See if the information on that page answers your question and then 
write back if you still have questions about any of this.
