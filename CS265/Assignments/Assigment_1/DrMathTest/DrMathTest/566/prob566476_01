Hi Stephen,

Before trying to 'work' the problem, it would be good to make sure you
understand what the problem is asking you.  

When we write

  4(something) 

that's shorthand for 

  4*something               '*' = multiplication

So this is really

  4*(2*y - 3) = 28

We're using 'y' to represent some number, whose value we don't yet
know, that makes the statement true.  For example, could y have a
value of 9?  let's try it:

  4*(2*9 - 3) =? 28           '=?' means we don't know whether
                                   it's actually equal...
   4*(18 - 3) =? 28

         4*15 =? 28

           60 =? 28  (Nope)

60 isn't equal to 28, so y can't be equal to 9.  By trial and error,
can you find the value of y that makes the equation true?  Try it, and
let me know what you come up with.  Then we can talk about other, more
efficient methods that you can use.
