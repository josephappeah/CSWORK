I think you are actually referring to a different item in the Dr. 
Math Archives:

  Transformation between (x,y) and (longitude, latitude)
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51833.html

I think a linear scaling will be fine for a map with maximum 
distances less than 10 miles, as your area suggests. It is hard to 
give a formula for the maximum error, but the following page from the 
Dr. Math Archives has a table that will help:

  Planar Approximation: Latitude and Longitude
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/62720.html

There is one assumption I didn't mention with the linear scaling 
formula: it assumes that the latitudes and longitudes at the corners 
of the map have been chosen so that the map will have the same scale 
horizontally and vertically. The Planar Approximation formula in the 
page I just mentioned will help you do this.

  x = (lon2-lon1)*cos(lat1)*pi/180
  y = (lat2-lat1)*pi/180

Here, x and y are in radians; if we want them in miles, we should use

  x = (lon2-lon1)*cos(lat1)*pi*R/180
  y = (lat2-lat1)*pi*R/180

where R is the radius of the earth, R = 6367 km = 3956 mi. Solving 
for lon2,lat2 in terms of x,y:

  lat2 = lat1 + y*180/(pi*R)
  lon2 = lon1 + x*180/(pi*R*cos(lat1))

If (lon1,lat1) is the center of the map, w pixels across and h pixels 
high, and you want a scale of n pixels on the map = one mile on 
earth, the latitudes and longitudes of the corners of the map should 
be

  lat = lat1 +or- (w/2)*n*180/(pi*R)
  lon = lon1 +or- (h/2)*n*180/(pi*R*cos(lat1))
