Hello, Kaz --

I presume you accidentally left the first digit off the answer you 
show, since the correct answer is the square root of 0.9 which is 
0.9486832981.

You certainly can't multiply the given number by 10 and get the 
answer to the question; as you say, doing that changes the whole 
problem and the answer too....
