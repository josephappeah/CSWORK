Hello Ann thanks for writing to Dr Math.

Drawing a diagram is often helpful in solving these types of problems.

                                  B
                                 /|
                                / |
                               /  |
                              /   | 8
                             /    |
                            /     |
                     ______/y_____|
                    | 6  x/O   6  .
                    |    /        .
                  8 |   /         .
                    |  /          .
                    | /           .
                    |/.............
                    A              P

We can then use Pythagoras's theorem to compute the length of the line 
from A to B.

Pythagoras's theorem is that the square of the length of the
hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of
the other two sides, e.g., 
 
     __a__
    |    /
    |   /
  b |  / c
    | /
    |/

   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 

In your problem A hint is to look at the triangle APB that I have 
constructed. We can see that it has a base of length 12 a height of 
length 16 and we want to know what the length AB is.

Can you solve the problem from here?

If you need more help feel free to write back to Dr Math.
