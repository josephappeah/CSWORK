Hi Mark,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You are correct that the three
limits are not equivalent.  The first two limits do give equivalent
definitions of the derivative, but the third limit, the symmetric
form, is a necessary (but not sufficient, as your example shows), 
condition for the existence of the derivative, so it cannot be used 
as a definition of the derivative.  This limit is a theorem, and it
must be proved.  Note that

   f(a+h) - f(a-h)   1 f(a+h) - f(a)   1 f(a) - f(a-h)
   --------------- = - ------------- + - -------------
          2h         2        h        2      h

The first term on the right clearly approaches f'(a) as h->0, if
f is differentiable at a, and the second term can be written

   f(a) - f(a-h)    -[f(a-h) - f(a)]
   ------------- =  ----------------
         h                  h
                   f(a-h) - f(a)
                 = -------------
                       (-h)

so if we let k = -h, this has the form

                   f(a+k) - f(a)
                 = -------------
                         k

and h->0 if and only if k->0, so it should be intuitively clear that

        f(a) - f(a-h)        f(a+k) - f(a)
   lim  ------------- = lim  -------------  ,
  h->0       h         k->0        k

and the limit on the right is clearly f'(a).

You can make this precise with an epsilon-delta argument.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
