You almost made it!  The answer is 48.

Here's how I'd find it.

Your unknown number x, when divided by 3 is a square, so

x/3 = n^2, for some n.

Now start trying different n:

n = 1 -> x = 3 -- doesn't work
n = 2 -> x = 12 -- doesn't work
n = 3 -> x = 36 -- doesn't work
n = 4 -> x = 48 -- works!

In fact, I didn't even try the first three, since I knew that the
result had to be at least 48, or you can't subtract 48 from it
and leave a positive result.  Thus the first number I tried
was n=4 and got the answer.

There may be additional answers, of course.  I just found
the smallest one.
