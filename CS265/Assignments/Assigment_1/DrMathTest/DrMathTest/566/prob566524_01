Hi Diane,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Let's start with a simpler problem.

5 gallons are needed.  Your friend is bringing 3 gallons.  That 
leaves how many for you?

2, right?

5 gallons (needed) MINUS 3 gallons (your friend) EQUALS 2 gallons 
(for you to bring).

5 - 3 = 2

Ok, so the way to solve this problem is subtraction.

3 1/2 needed

1 7/8 by your friend

So you need to bring:

  3 1/2 - 1 7/8

The first step in subtracting mixed numbers is to change them to 
improper fractions.  For help on this, check out:

  Converting Fractions to/from Mixed Numbers

So the amount you need to bring is:

  7/2 - 15/8

The next step is to find a common denominator.  If you multiply the 
numerator and denominator of 7/2 by 4/4 you get 28/8, which gives you 
a common denominator:

  28/8 - 15/8

Now you just need to subtract and then change back to a mixed number 
and that will tell you how much water to bring.

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
