This Frequently Answered Questions page discusses such properties 
(in more advanced language):

  Properties glossary
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.property.glossary.html

The "grouping" property presumably refers to the "associative" 
property, which says that, for example,

  2 + (3 + 4) = (2 + 3) + 4

because it doesn't matter how you group the additions, doing the 3+4 
and then adding it to 2, or doing the 2+3 and then adding 4.

The "order" property would be what adults call the "commutative" 
property, which says that the order of the numbers themselves does 
not affect the result; for example,

  2 + 3 = 3 + 2

As for "addends", that means "numbers that are being added 
together", like the 2 and 3 in the last example. The order of the 
addends is what the "order" property is about; the "grouping" 
property is about the order in which the additions are done. Here is 
a page on that word and others like it:

  Multiplier, Sum, Difference, Product, Quotient, Dividend
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58398.html

  Parts of a Subtraction Problem
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58801.html

But the problem itself seems confusing to me! I don't like the way 
it's worded. The lines don't represent properties, just facts (that 
9+3=12, for instance). The properties are represented by the 
relationship between the lines -- that two additions in columns a 
and c equal the same number in column b for a particular reason.

The fact that 3+9 and 9+3 both equal 12 illustrates the "order" 
property; if you left something out and meant (2+3)+6, then the fact 
that that equals 2+(3+6) illustrates the "grouping" property. So I 
suppose it's clear what was intended (color each PAIR of lines the 
appropriate color).

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
