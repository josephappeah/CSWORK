Hi Rita,

Draw a horizontal line for the ground.  Mark two points on the ground
for the two people, and mark the distance between them 1000 feet.  Put
a point up in the air (for the airplane), between the two people, and
draw lines connecting the airplane to the two people, marking the
angles 35 degrees and 40 degrees.  Then drop a perpendicular from the
airplane to the ground, and mark that distance "h" (or x or something
else).  That is the distance you want to calculate.  See if you can
take it from there.  You might find helpful the formulas at

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
