Hi Michelle,

 Would you mind explaining what you mean by y* (and e*)?
Let us know so we can suggest an appropriate numerical method to use.

There's quite a few methods that you can apply: Newton's method 
(if you know derivatives), the bisection method, the secant method, 
the false position method, etc.  I mention these just in case you
want to do some research on your own. 

Also, you didn't provide us with a definition for the function f(t). 
As it stands, based on the information you've given us, we won't be 
able to tell you much.  Are there missing parts to the question that
you forgot to include?
