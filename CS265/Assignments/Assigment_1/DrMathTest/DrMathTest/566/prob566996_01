Hi Wuyicheng,

You have a second-order linear recurrence relation but only one
initial value.  There is no way to determine a(1) from the information
given, or a(3) or any other value besides a(2).  You can get a general
solution in terms of a(1) and a(2), but you still need two values two
determine any other values in the sequence.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
