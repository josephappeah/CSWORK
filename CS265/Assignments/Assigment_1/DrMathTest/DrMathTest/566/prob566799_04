Hi Lorex,

The law that Dr Greenie implicitly referred to is called the

  Intermediate Value Theorem,

and you can find a proof of it in any good calculus or analysis text.

Secondly, yes, you only need to find n and m such that

  f(n) < 0 < f(m)

and then you know that f(x) has a root between n and m, as long as
f(x) is a continuous function.  If you are concerned that the range
from n to m (or from m to n) is too large, then choose a point k in
between n and m, and check if f(k) is positive or negative.  In this
way, you can cut your interval in half.  Repeat as much as you like to
get as small an interval as you want.

Third, yes again.  You can write out general formulas for bounds
involving the degree of the polynomial and all of the coefficients. 
For example, if

  f(x) = x^n + a_(n-1)*x^(n-1) + ... + a_2*x^2 + a_1*x + a_0

then every root x of f(x) = 0 has

                 n-1
  |x| <= max( 1, sum |a_i| )
                 i=0

which is easily proven by dividing f(x) = 0 by x^(n-1) and then using
the triangle inequality.  This is not the best bound that can be
found, but it's easy to prove.

Fourth, there most certainly are discontinuous functions.  I will let
you prove that they are not continuous, but I can give you some examples:

  f(x) = [x],

the so-called "greatest integer function" or "floor function" which
returns the largest integer less than or equal to x.  This is
discontinuous at every integer value of x, continuous at all
non-integer values.

           0:  if x is rational
  g(x) = {
           1:  if x is irrational

This function is discontinous at every value for x, and it provides a
nice counterexample for many false theorems.

If you have any other questions about this or need more help, please
write back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try
to offer further suggestions.
