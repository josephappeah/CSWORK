Hi Coreena,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

>Would you use a log to estimate or calculate...

Yes, that is the right idea.  You can easily determine that 10^345
has 346 digits:

  number range    no digits
     1 - 9           1
     10-99           2
     100-999         3    etc.

Note that 1 = 10^0, 10 = 10^1, 100 = 10^2 , so if

   10^n <= N < 10^(n+1)-1 ,

then N has (n+1) (decimal) digits.  Also note that

    n <= log_10(N) < n+1 ,

so you can determine n by taking the integer part of log_10(N).

If you look at binary expansions, you will find a similar
relationship between the number of binary digits and the logarithm
to the base 2.

Finally, you can compute logarithms to a given base from logarithms
to any other base by using the change of base formula:

              log_b(x)
   log_a(x) = --------
              log_b(a)   .


If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
