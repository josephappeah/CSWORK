Hello Damon,  

You said,

"I need an equation that will calculate the minor axis of an Ellipse 
where I have the Area, Major Axis Length and Angle of elevation from 
the X axis of the segment."

If you know the area pi*a*b of the ellipse and you know either a or b, then the other of a 
or b can be calculated.
