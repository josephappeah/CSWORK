Hello Sania,

The triangles are "similar," which means that corresponding parts of the two triangles are 
in the same ratio.

If the sides are a, b, and c for one triangle and A, B, and C for the other, then

a/A=b/B=c/C, where k is some constant.

Let's suppose that a=4, b=7.5, and c=8.5.

From a/A=b/B=c/C we see that  a/b = A/B and a/c = A/C.  So,

4/7.5=A/B  and  4/8.5=A/C.

If C=12 (we're guessing, but there are only three possibililties), then
from 4/8.5=A/12, we find that A=12*4/8.5.  From there we can calculate B and C.  I'd 
check to see if everything is consistent.
