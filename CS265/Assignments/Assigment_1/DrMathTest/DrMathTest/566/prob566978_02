Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The question is not entirely mathematical. Psychology is involved in a
major way. So, there's no way to actually put a number on it, unless
you perform some tests (i.e. try it out on actual shelves and measure
sales). 

There's also the question of which shelves you command. People are
(probably) more likely to pick items at or near eye level than items
on the bottom shelf. So, if your 80% happened to be everywhere except
eye level, it would probably be worse than placing the same items at
eye level. Visual appeal, cost, name-recognition, and other factors
would, of course, make their own contributions to sales.
