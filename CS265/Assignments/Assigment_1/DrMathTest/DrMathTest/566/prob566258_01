Hi Roger.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  If you fix the teams in 
the bracket before counting (i.e. the starting teams are
({1 vs 2} vs {3 vs 4}) vs ({5 vs 6} vs {7 vs 8}), then there
are seven games, each of which can have two possible outcomes.
Thus there are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 128 ways for this
tournament to get played out.

If you allow the teams to fill into the bracket in different
ways, then you'll have to be more careful about what is a different
scenario:  certainly (1 v 2) v (3 v 4) is different from (1 v 3) v
(2 v 4) because the teams meet different opponents in the first
round, but is (1 v 2) v (3 v 4) different from (3 v 4) v (2 v 1)?
