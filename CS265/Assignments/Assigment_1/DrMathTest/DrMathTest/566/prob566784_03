Below I have described the principle in terms of probabilities, but 
the same reasoning applies to 'number of arrangements'.

Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
------------------------------
It is easy to illustrate the principle with two or three 
probabilities using a Venn diagram.

For example with two overlapping probabilities P(A), P(B), we have 

   P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

The overlapping region, A and B, is added in with P(A) and added in 
again with P(B), so to get it added in once only we must then 
subtract it, giving rise to the expression shown above.

With three overlapping probabilities P(A), P(B) and P(C) we get

P(A or B or C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) 
                 - P(A and B) - P(B and C) - P(C and A)
                 + P(A and B and C)

now the overlap of all 3 probabilities is added in 3 times by the 
first line of this equation, subtracted 3 times by the second line 
of the equation and so must be added in again by the third line.

The area corresponding to A and B BUT NOT C is added in twice in the 
first line and subtracted once in the second line, so it will appear 
once as is required.  Similarly for area B and C but not A, and the 
area corresponding to C and A but not B, each will eventually appear 
once only

With more probabilities the pattern continues and the proof by 
induction is not difficult but a little tedious.  The 
name 'inclusion-exclusion' describes exactly what is happening.  
Regions are being added a number of times and subtracted a number of 
times in such a way that each region occurs exactly once.
