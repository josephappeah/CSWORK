Hi Haley,

Sometimes it can help to look at simpler numbers.  Suppose I have $15,
and that's 50% too much.  If I divide it into three parts, 

  $5, $5, $5

I can see that the third part is 50% of the sum of the other two:

  $5 is 50% of ($5 + $5)

So in fact, your strategy (divide by 2, multiply by 3) would work fine.

Here's another way to look at it.  Suppose the correct amount is A. 
We know that $3,226,000 is 50% more than A, which means it's 150% of A:

  $3,226,000 = 150% of A

             = 1.5 * A

             = (3/2) * A

To find A, we divide both sides by 3/2:

  $3,226,000 
  ---------- = A
     3/2

But to divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:

  $3,226,000 * (2/3) = A

But this is just dividing by three, and then multiplying by 2.

Does that make sense?
