Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The worst case is if there are a maximal number of people with
birthdays in other months. For example, if you had 12 people, you
could have 1 person born in each month. You could not guarantee, for
example, that 2 people were born in a single month. 

But, if you had 13 people, you would absolutely know that at least 2
of the people were born in the same month. In the worst case, 12
people would be born in different months. The 13th person would have
to share a month with someone else.

Let's go further. With 24 people, you could not guarantee that 3
people were born in a single months. It is possible that 2 people were
born in each month. But with 25 people, it must be the case that 3 of
the people were born in the same month.

Do you see how to extend this reasoning to your problem?
