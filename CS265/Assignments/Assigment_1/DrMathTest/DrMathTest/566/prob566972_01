One inch at what distance?  In other words, if you hold a ruler
perpendicular to the ground and move it toward and away from 
your eye until one inch on it appears to be exactly as tall as the
tree, what you need to measure is the distance from the ruler to
your eye.

Since the tree is 600 times as tall as the one inch, it will be
600 times as far away from your eye as the ruler is.
