Hi Subhankar,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Yes, there is.  It's called modular
arithmetic.  Do you know what that is?  You can start here:

  Mod, Modulus, Modular Arithmetic

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
