Hi Tyrone,

Those are both examples of numbers between zero and one.  Note that
given any two numbers, we can always find a number halfway between
them this way:

                     first number + second number
  number in middle = ----------------------------
                                  2

For example, we might start with 0 and 2.  The number halfway between is 

  0 + 2 
  ----- = 1
    2

We can do it again with 0 and 1.  The number halfway between is

  0 + 1
  ----- = 1/2
    2

We can do it again with 0 and 1/2.  The number halfway between is

  0 + 1/2
  ------- = 1/4
     2

And so on: 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32.  There's no limit to how small
we can make these numbers.  

Note that just as we found numbers between 0 and 1, we could find
numbers between 1 and 2, or 17 and 18, or 1/2 and 3/4, or ANY TWO
NUMBERS AT ALL. 

Does this help?
