Hi Tom.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  You are correct in that
you have to define exactly what you mean by "smooth".  The
word "smooth" actually has a mathematical meaning (involving the
number of continuous derivatives):

  Eric W. Weisstein. "Smooth Function." 
  From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. 
  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SmoothFunction.html 

and what happens at the endpoints may or may not be important.
In some loose sense the function

  f(x) = x       -1 < x < 1

is the smoothest, since all derivatives after the first one vanish.
However, you may want the slope at the endpoints to be zero (you 
didn't specify this).  You can arrange it so that *all* derivatives
of the transition function f exist and are zero at x=+1 and x=-1.  
You can do this by building it up from the function

  g(y) = e^(-1/y^2)    y <> 0
       = 0             y = 0

This function g is differentiable to all orders (and the derivatives
are all zero at y=0)--if you graph g vs. y, you will see that it is
very flat through the region near y=0.  But the fact that g(y) is
nonzero for y<>0 means that we can use it to transition from one
value to another:

   h(x) = 1 - g(x-1)            for 0 < x < 1
        
has the right behavior at x=+1:  h(x->1-) = 1, and all of its
derivatives are zero at x=+1.  Now you can combine this with
an analogous function that helps in the region near x=-1:

   k(x) = -1 + g(x+1)

Now, if h(0) = k(0), we'd be nearly done, but h(0) = 1 - g(-1) > 0
k(0) = -1 + g(1) < 0, so they don't meet up.  We can fix this by
a simple trick:
          
          x+1        1-x
   f(x) = --- h(x) + --- k(x)     0 < |x| < 1
           2          2

   f(x) = x                       |x| = 1

Note how the transition has been constructed to have f(x->1-) = 
(2/2)*h(x->1-) = 1 and f(x->-1+) = (2/2)*k(->-1+) = -1.  And what
happens at x=0?  We have f(0) = [h(0) + k(0)]/2 = 
[1 - g(-1) - 1 + g(1)]/2 = 0/2 = 0, so it goes through the origin.

Of course, this may not be what you meant by "smoothest" (if you
are worried about maintaining low slope, low acceleration, etc.).
I hope that this helps, but if I misinterpreted your question, please
feel free to write back and clarify it.
