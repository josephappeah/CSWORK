I don't know what you mean. Zero is a number. It is a member of many 
classes of numbers as well: it is an integer, an even number, a 
rational number, a real number, and a complex number. If you want a 
term that fits zero and no other number, "additive identity" fits the 
bill: zero is the (only) number that, when added to any number, gives 
that same number as a result.
