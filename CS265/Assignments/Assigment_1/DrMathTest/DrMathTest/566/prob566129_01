Don,
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you can't do it.  At least
not uniquely.  Suppose A is the length of 1 leg of your right
triangle, B is the length of the other leg and C is the length of the
hypotenuse.  Then the Pythagorean theorem tells us that:

 A^2 + B^2 = C^2

That's 3 variables.   If you know C, that still leaves 2 unknowns with
only 1 equation.  So there are an infinite number of solutions.  We
can rearrange Pythagoras's Formula to generate solutions, but they
won't be unique.  Let's take a look at that:

 B = sqrt(C^2 - A^2)

Here, if you know the length of leg A, in addition to the hypotenuse,
you can solve for the length of leg B.  Just remember that A has to be
in the range (0, c).  You don't want to have a 0-length side, nor can
you have a leg with length greater than or equal to the hypotenuse.

In general, to "solve" a triangle (that is, to determine all the
angles and sides), you need 3 pieces of information.  This is true for
any triangle, not just right triangles.  Those 3 can be any
combination of sides and angles EXCEPT 3 angles.  In the case of 3
angles, you can only determine the ratio of the lengths of the sides.

I'm sorry I couldn't help you further.  If you come up with another
constraint on your triangle, let me know and we can work through that
together.
