Hi, Alice.

Thanks for writing to Doctor Math.  Your question seems more 
focused on math education than an actual math problem, and so 
instead of Doctor Math, you should write to our math education 
question and answer service, Teacher2Teacher.  

The URL of the submission page is:

  http://mathforum.org/t2t/

If you want to discuss curriculum ideas, professional development, 
or anything else about math education, send them your question.  
They are a great resource.
