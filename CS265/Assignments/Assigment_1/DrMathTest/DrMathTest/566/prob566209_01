Hi Lauren,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Sometimes on an assignment, you may
be directed to use one method or the other, just for practice and
to show that you know the technique, very similar to the way one
does calisthenics to get in physical shape.

However, if you're solving a problem, and no method is dictated by
a teacher, for example, you can use whatever method you wish.  With
practice, some quadratics are easy to factor, and if I can see a
factorization easily, I'd probably use that.  But if I can't see how 
to factor a quadratic easily, then I would use the Quadratic Formula,
because it ALWAYS works, and there is no guessing or trial-and-error.
You just substitute into the formula and crank out the answer.

For your factoring attempt,

>2x^2-7x-4= 0

you need to look at the factors of the coefficient of x^2, 2 in
this case: 2 = 1*2, and aside from order, that is the only way to
factor 2 (i.e. 2 is prime).  The constant term 4 can be factored in
two ways: 4 = 1*4 or 4 = 2*2.

Since 2 has only the one factorization, if the polynomial can be 
factored with integer coefficients, then it must be of the form

   (2x +/ ?) (x +/- ?)  .

Since the constant term is negative, the two constant terms in the
factors must have opposite signs, so you either have the form

   (2x + ?)(x - ?)    or (2x - ?)(x + ?)  .

Now it is a mattter of trial and error:  you just list all the 
possibilities and check them out.

   (2x + ?)(x - ?)    or (2x - ?)(x + ?)
         1      4              1      4
         4      1              4      1
         2      2              2      2   .

At worst, you have to make six computations, but you might get lucky
and find a factorization on the first or second try.

Using the Quadratic Formula eliminates all this guesswork, and
cranks out the answer, although you may have to do some simplification.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
