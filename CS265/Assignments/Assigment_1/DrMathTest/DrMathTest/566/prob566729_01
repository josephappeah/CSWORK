You are on the surface of the earth at a latitude of 37 degrees north
of the equator and 121 degrees west of the prime meridian.  The
prime meridian is a line that runs from the north to the south pole
through the observatory in Greenwich, England, which is near London.

Most maps have latitude and longitude marked on the edges, so
you can draw cross-hairs with a north-south and an east-west
line.  You are where they cross.
