Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Aryan!

Assume that X2 - X1 and X4 - X3 are nonzero.  Let the slope of
line 1 be m1 and the slope of line 2 be m2.  Then

   m1 = (Y2-Y1)/(X2-X1),
   m2 = (Y4-Y3)/(X4-X3).

Then the inclinations A1 and A2 of the two lines are given by

   A1 = Arctan(m1),
   A2 = Arctan(m2).

If X2 - X1 = 0, then line 1 is vertical, and its inclination A1 is
Pi/2 radians.  If X4 - X3 = 0, then line 2 is vertical, and its
inclination A2 is Pi/2 radians.

Now notice that there are two angle bisectors.  The first is the
bisector of angle P1OP3, the second the bisector of angle P1OP4.
They are perpendicular to each other.  The inclinations B1 and B2
of the two angle bisectors are

   B1 = (A1+A2)/2,
   B2 = (A1+A2+Pi)/2.

The slopes m3 and m4 of the two angle bisectors are then

   m3 = tan(B1),
   m4 = tan(B2) = -cot(B1).

Now if neither m3 nor m4 is zero, with these two slopes and the
point O, you can write the equations of the angle bisectors,

   y = m3*(x-X) + Y,
   y = m4*(x-X) + Y.

If m3 = 0 or m4 = 0, then the equations of the angle bisectors are

   y = Y,
   x = X.

Then a point with coordinates (x,y) satisfying either of the angle
bisector equations will lie on one of those two angle bisectors.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
