Once you are going at 100 mph, it does take .02 hours to go a mile.
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so that is (.02)(3600) = 72
seconds (assuming a constant rate of speed of 100 mph).

If you need to start from zero, get to 100 mph, and then complete
the two miles, it will take a bit longer.  Assuming your car can
continue to acceleerate at the same rate from 60 to 100 (which
is probably a bit optimistic), it will take (10/7)(7.6) = 10.1 seconds
to get to 100 mph from a standing start.  During the acceleration
phase, your average speed is 50mph, so you'll need to add about
5 seconds to the 72 above to get the answer to the question:

Starting from stopped, accelerating as fast as the car will go,
and staying at 100 mph after I reach that speed, how long will
it take to go 2 miles.  The answer is about 77 seconds.  And
in reality, I'd guess a couple more; maybe 79 seconds.
