Hi Deanna,

Instead of showing you, I'd like to see if we can't get to it
together.  Plot those two points on a sheet, and tell me in your own
words:  

  If you were at the point (5,3), and you needed to move to 
  the point (1,4), how far would you have to move in the x
  direction?  (Moving to the right is positive; moving to
  the left is negative.)  How about in the y direction?  
  (Up is positive, down is negative.)

Let me know what you come up with.
