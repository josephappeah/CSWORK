Hi Steve,

The domain is the set of possible inputs and the range is the set of 
possible outputs.  For example, in

        y = sqrt(x-4)

The quantity (x-4) must be greater than or equal to zero (do you see 
why?).  Therefore,

           x-4 >= 0

So the domain is x >= 4.  The domain will determine the range,

                y = sqrt(x-4) = sqrt(4-4) = sqrt(0) = 0

So y >= 0.  Does this help?
