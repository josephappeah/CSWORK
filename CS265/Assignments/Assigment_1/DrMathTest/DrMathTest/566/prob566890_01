Hello Patrick,

You may already know the formula for the area of a polygon with vertices
(x1,y1),...,(xn,yn).  The sides of the polygon should be non-intersecting.  This formula can 
be found at

I suspect that one could find a formula for the volume you mention, beneath a general 
plane, but I've not heard of such a formula.
