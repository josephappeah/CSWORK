Hello Kasie,

You're right.  The two vertical lines around a number take the
"absolute value" of the number inside.  Here are a couple of examples:

|2| = 2
|-2| = 2
|-6.71| = 6.71
|0| = 0
|.0002| = .0002

If you don't know what x is, then |x| might be x and it might be -x,
since x may stand for a negative number.  In other words, it is NOT
necessarily true that:

|x| = x

If x = -7, for example, then |x| = |-7| = 7 = -x

In your original problem, you are correct that x=7 is a solution, but
there is another: x = -7.  Do you see why?
