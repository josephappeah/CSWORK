The first thing to do is to find out what "domain" means. Do you have 
a definition? If not, you can use the Search Dr. Math button to 
search our site for the words "function" and "domain", and find a 
page that talks about what it means. Here is one:

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back. Show me 
what you've done with one of your problems, and I'll help you see 
whether you are on the right track.
