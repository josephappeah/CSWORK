Hi, Brenda --

This is an easy problem if you draw the line down the middle 
lengthwise -- but I assume that is not what you want to do.  And 
determining where to draw the line to divide the area in two the 
other way is not an easy problem.

We have to make some assumptions about the problem.  I assume the 4-
foot and 2-foot ends are parallel and that you want to draw a line 
parallel to those two ends to divide the area into two equal parts.

Here is a very crude picture -- not to scale -- of what I think we 
are trying to do:

                G
  D ************************ C
     *          *         *
      *         * P      *
     E ****************** F
        *       *      *
         *      *     *
          *     *    *
           *    *   *
          A ******** B
                H

We have AB = 2 feet and CD = 4 feet; and GH is 60 feet.  We want to 
find where to draw EF so that it divides the area of trapezoid ABCD 
into two equal parts.  So we want to find where to place line EF so 
that ABFE and CDEF have the same area.  One relatively easy way to 
think of this is that ABFE has to have half the area of ABCD.

The formula for the area of a trapezoid is

  Area = (average of the two bases) times (height)

The original trapezoid has bases 4 and 2 feet and height 60 feet; 
this gives an area of 180 square feet.  So we need to find where to 
place EF so that ABFE has an area of 90 square feet.

Suppose we call the length of HP "x".  The ratio of HP to HG is then 
x/60.  Assuming the sides BC and AD are straight lines, the length 
of EF is then equal to the length of AB plus x/60 of the difference 
between the lengths of AB and CD.

We now have expressions for the lengths of the two bases and the 
height of ABFE, so we can find an expression for its area.  Setting 
that expression equal to the desired value of 90 and solving will 
give us the solution to the problem.  We have, for ABFE,

  base AB = 2

  base FE = 2 + (x/60)*(4-2) = 2 + x/30

  height = x

  Area = ((4 + x/30)/2)*x

So we need to solve the equation

  ((4 + x/30)/2)*x = 90

The algebra doesn't work out very "nicely"; my graphing calculator 
shows the answer to be

  x = 34.86833  (approximately)

Plugging this value back into the formula above for the area of ABFE 
does indeed give the area of ABFE as 90 square feet.

I hope you can follow all of this, and that it help....

Please write back if you have any further questions about any of 
this.
