It won't be a polygon. It could be a "star polygon". For example, 
consider a 5-pointed star. In tracing around the 5 sides, you make 5 
angles but you make two full turns (720 degrees) in the process, so 
the exterior angles are each 720/5 = 144 degrees. You can derive a 
general formula for the exterior angles of star polygons following 
this example, and from the formula deduce how many points yours will 
have and how many times you must go around. It isn't a common figure. 
Perhaps there is something else stated in the problem that allows 
another answer, but this is all I can think of.
