The surface area of a sphere is

  S = 4 pi r^2

That is, 4 times the area of a circle with the same radius. This can 
be expressed in terms of the diameter as

  S = pi D^2

Square your diameter, 26 inches, and multiply by 3.14 to get the 
area in square inches.

The formula can be found in our FAQ under Formulas.

The trouble is, if you are actually trying to cover a ball with 
paper or cloth, you will have to cut, sew, or wrinkle it in order to 
cover, so you will need extra material (unless you are able to 
stretch it, and don't need sewing or overlap allowances). And if you 
make each patch (which would take only one measurement, since all 
edges are the same length), and glue it on (which will work if your 
material has a little stretch), there will be scrap material between 
the pieces you cut out.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
