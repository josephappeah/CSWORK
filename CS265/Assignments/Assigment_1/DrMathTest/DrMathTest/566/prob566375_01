I have no idea what that means; commas are not used in algebraic 
notation. My best guess would be that you are expected to do one 
calculation after another, first getting 10, then multiplying by 3, 
then dividing by 2. But since there are no rules for non-standard 
notations, there's no reason to say I'm right.

Can you tell me where this came from, and whether there are any hints 
in the context to help us figure out what is intended?
