Hi Sifiso,

First of all, you're mixing x's and t's, which you probably didn't
mean to do.

You were told correctly.  So don't bother integrating it.  Think of it
like you were asked to plot the graph of:

  y = x^2/cosh(sqrt(x)).

You wouldn't know how to graph that, either, would you?  So you would
have to use some calculus to find where it's increasing and where it's
decreasing and where the local maxes and mins are, and things like
that, and those all involve starting with the derivative.  Well, you
know the derivative, so you get to skip a step!  You don't have to
find the derivative!

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
