Here's how I'd do it.  I'd find _one_ combination that works, and then
take advantage of the fact that I can exchange 8 5-cent stamps for 5
8-cent stamps.  

How to find the first one?  Start subtracting 8 cents from $2.43 until
you get something divisible by 5:

  2.43, 2.35, ...      

Got one!  So I can have 1 8-cent stamp, and 235/5 = 47 5-cent stamps.
 Now I just exchange:
  
  8 cents   5 cents
  -------   -------
  1         47
  6         39
  11        31

(Note that this is pretty much what you were doing, but I'm counting
stamps, rather than money, so my numbers are easier to deal with.) 

But wait!  How many times will I be able to do this?  That's just
47/8, which is just under 6.  So I'll be able to make 5 exchanges:

  8 cents   5 cents
  -------   -------
  1         47
  6         39
  11        31
  16        23
  21        15
  26         7

I completed the table to verify that there are 6 combinations, but I
didn't need to do that.  I just had to 

  1) Find the first combination
  2) Compute the maximum number of exchanges
  3) Add 

I don't know of a faster way than this to do it.
