Hi Sam,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  According to the Theory of Relativity,
nothing can move faster than the speed of light.  For a comet to go
close to that speed, it would have to be in close orbit around a very
massive star or black hole (comets have very elliptical orbits,
meaning that they are in orbit but not in a circle).  Of course,
depending on what it is made of, this kind of speed near such a
massive star would probably tear it apart rather quickly.  So the
answer to your question depends on things like:

  What the comet is made of.
  The size of the star it orbits.
  The distance from the star.

But if you made the comet out of the right stuff, and you sent it
really close to a big black hole, then it could (theoretically) get
close to the speed of light.

But perhaps you really want to know something else.  Perhaps you have
a particular comet in mind, and you know the shape of its orbit, and
you know what star it orbits (e.g. our sun), and you want to know what
is this particular comet's top speed, which will always happen when
the comet is closest to the star/sun.  Is that what you wanted to
know?  If so, then what do you already know about the orbit of the
comet?  Also:  You could probably look this up for any comet that you
know about.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
