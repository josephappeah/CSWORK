Hi Shellie,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Our FAQ has a page which explains a lot about word problems.  There 
are also links in it that show you specific examples of word problems 
from our archives and a couple other pages on the internet that talk 
about doing word problems.

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
