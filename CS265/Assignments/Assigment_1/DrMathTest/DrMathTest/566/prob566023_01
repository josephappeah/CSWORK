Hi Omar,

It depends on what you mean by that.  I can do it infinitely many
times, if I think about it this way:

  50 - 5 = 45               That's one.
  50 - 5 = 45               That's two.
  50 - 5 = 45               And so on. 

But perhaps you mean that each time I should do the subtraction from
the new difference?

  50 - 5 = 45               That's one.
  45 - 5 = 40               That's two.
  40 - 5 = 35               And so on. 
  
The answer then depends on when you're supposed to stop.  I can keep
going forever:

  10 - 5 =   5
   5 - 5 =   0
   0 - 5 =  -5
  -5 - 5 = -10

But if you mean, how many times can you do it until you reach zero,
that's just another way of asking:  "What is 50 divided by 5?"

Does this help?
