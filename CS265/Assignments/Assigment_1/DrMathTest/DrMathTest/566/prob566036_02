Hi Lindsey,

Sometimes the way to proceed is to start with a small case and build
your way up.  Suppose there are just two poles, A and B:

    A................B

For that, we just need one streamer, right?  Now, suppose we add a
third pole, C:


    A...............B
      .           .
        .       .
          .   .
            C 
             
We need two more streamers: one from the new pole to each of the poles
we had already.  Let's make a table to keep track of what's happening:

  Poles       Streamers
  --------    ---------
  A, B        1
  A, B, C     1+2

Let's add a fourth pole, D.  Now we'll need _three_ more streamers:
one from the new pole to each pole we had already.

  Poles         Streamers
  ----------    ---------
  A, B          1
  A, B, C       1+2 
  A, B, C, D    1+2+3 

Can you see a pattern forming?  What will happen when we add a 5th
pole, E?
