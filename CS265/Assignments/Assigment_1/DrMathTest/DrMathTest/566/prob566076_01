Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

It's a logic problem. Each of the boxes is labeled incorrectly. If the
boxes are known to be labeled incorrect, what can you conclude by
drawing a single ball from "black and white"?

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
