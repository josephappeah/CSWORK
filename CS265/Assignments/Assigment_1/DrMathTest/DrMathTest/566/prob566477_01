Hi Joann,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It depends on which "distance" you are
talking about, but you probably meant the diagonal, since you clearly
didn't mean the length or width.  In that case, you should refer to:

  Pythagorean theorem

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
