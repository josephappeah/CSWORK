Hi Anne.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

From what you've told me, each base of the prism is a "regular"
hexagon (i.e. all sides equal and all angles equal) with side 
length = 40 cm and the height of the prism is 80 cm.

Each hexagon is composed of six triangles:

     +---+
    / \ / \ 40
   +---+---+      you computed the area of each triangle 
    \ / \ /       correctly:  40*34.64/2 = 692.8 cm^2
     +---+

So the area of the hexagon is six times this, or 4156.8 cm^2.

Then the area of the base of the prism (i.e. the hexagon) is
then multiplied by the height to obtain the total volume:

   volume = base area x prism height = 4156.8 cm^2 x 80 cm
          = 330000 cm^2

where I've rounded the answer to account for the precision in the
original data (two digits).

The only mistake that you made is to take the area of both top
and bottom hexagons together.  Although you would need to do this
if you were calculating the total surface area of the prism, you 
do not do this when calculating the prism volume--the base area 
is just the area of one hexagon.
