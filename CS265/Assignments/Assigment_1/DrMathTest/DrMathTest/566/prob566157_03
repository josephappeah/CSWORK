Hi,

If you think about it, you can put the remaining 489 marbles in the
last box, and it will still work. Using the first 9 boxes, you can
make any number from 1 to 511. You can make any number from 512 to
1000 by using 489 and adding a number from 1 to 511.

    512 = 489 + 23
    513 = 489 + 24
    and so on

Hope this helps.
