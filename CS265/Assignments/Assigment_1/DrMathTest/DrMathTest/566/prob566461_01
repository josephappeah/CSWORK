The first throw will certainly produce a new number.  We must now 
find expected number of throws to the next new number.  This has 
probability 5/6 of being new, so we set up a difference equation as 
follows.  Let a = expected number of trials to second new number.  
We must make one trial at least and we have a probability 5/6 of 
getting a new number and 1/6 of going to '1+a'

So  a = (5/6)1 + (1/6)(1+a)

   5/6 a = 1     so a = 6/5

For the third new number let b = expected number of further trials.  
This time there is prob. 2/3 of a new number and 1/3 of going to 1+b.

    b = (2/3)1 + (1/3)(1+b)

   2/3 b = 1     so  b = 3/2 = 6/4

and to the fourth new number we have

    c = (1/2)1 + (1/2)(1+c)

   1/2 c = 1   so  c = 2  = 6/3 

The pattern is now clear.  The expected number of trials to 6 new 
numbers is:

  E(no. of trials)  = 6/6 + 6/5 + 6/4 + 6/3 + 6/2 + 6/2 + 6/1

                    = 6[1/6 + 1/5 + 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/1]

                    = 6 x 49/20

                    =  14.7

So on average you should get all six numbers by the 15th throw.
