Hi Giovanni.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  After consulting some other
people I have still not found an algorithm for quickly evaluating 
the fifth power of a number (between 1 and 100).  However, there
are numerous references to extracting the fifth ROOT (of a perfect
fifth power between 1 and 100000.  The method is fairly straight-
forward to discover, once you have identified the units digit as the
same in both k^5 and k.
