Hi, Ben --

In that notation, the "n" and "1" on "an" and "a1" are subscripts; 
they identify the position of that element of a sequence.  We can 
represent the subscript in typed text using parentheses -- for 
example, a(1) and a(n).  Since these subscripts identify the 
position of the element in a sequence, we have

  an = a(1) = 1st element in sequence
  a2 = a(2) = 2nd element
  ...
  an = a(n) = n-th element

Of course, either "an" or "a(n)" in different contexts often 
indicates multiplication; but in the context of sequences and 
series, it usually indicates subscripting.

So the formula you show -- rewritten in the form

  a(n) = a(1)*r^(n-1)

simply tells you what is obvious from the definition of a geometric 
sequence:  the n-th term ("a(n)") is equal to the first term ("a
(1)"), multiplied by the common ratio ("r") (n-1) times.

I hope this helps clear things up for you.  Write back if you have 
any further questions about any of this.
