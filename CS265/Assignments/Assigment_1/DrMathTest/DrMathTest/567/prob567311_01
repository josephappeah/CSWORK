Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Xany!

Let the width of the road be x meters.  Then the picture should look
like this:

   o------------------------------o
   |            road              |
   |x                             |
   o------------------------o     |
   |                        |     | 20
   |                        |     |
   |20-x                    |     |
   |                        |     |
   |          30-x          |  x  |
   o------------------------o-----o
                 30

Here 0 < x < 20.

Using this, you should be able to get an expression for the smaller
rectangular area in terms of x.  Set that equal to 184 m^2, and solve
for x.  Then the dimensions sought are 20-x and 30-x meters.

Hint:  x and the dimensions are not rational numbers.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
