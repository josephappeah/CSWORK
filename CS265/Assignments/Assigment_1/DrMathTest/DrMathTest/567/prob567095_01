Hi Shaeleen,

I'm not quite sure what you're asking.  Do you mean you have to find
at least one expression for each of the numbers 1 through 25, e.g., 

  (2 - 1) * (4 - 3) = 1

  (2 - 1) + (4 - 3) = 2

  (2 + 1) * (4 - 3) = 3

and so on?  Or do you just want to generate as many expressions as you
can, so long as they end up giving you a result between 1 and 25?
