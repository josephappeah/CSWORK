Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Alex!

Exactly what do you mean by an algebraic formula for the cube root
of a + b*i?  Why isn't (a+b*i)^(1/3) such a formula?  Are a and b
integers, rational numbers, algebraic numbers, or general real
numbers?

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
