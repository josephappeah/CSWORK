Hi Wally,

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that if f(x) is continuous
on [a,b], then
 
          x
         /
  F(x) = | f(t) dt 
         /
         a

is differentiable on (a,b), and for any c in (a,b),

   F'(c) = f(c),

so F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x).

The archived answer gives a proof of this result.
