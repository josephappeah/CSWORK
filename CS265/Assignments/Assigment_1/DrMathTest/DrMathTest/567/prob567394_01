Hi Travis,

Let's look at something similar, but less mathematical.  Is the
following always, sometimes, or never true?

   The distance between two cities is less than 1000 miles.

There are many pairs of cities for which this is true (e.g., Los
Angeles and San Francisco, Paris and London), but there are also some
pairs of cities for which it's not true (e.g., Paris and Sydney,
Australia).  So the answer would be 'sometimes'. 

What about this statement?  

   The distance between two cities is more than a million miles.

In this case, there's no place on earth that you can get to that's a
million miles from any other place, so the answer would be 'never'. 

And for 

   The distance between two planets is greater than a mile,

the answer would be 'always'. 

So that's what kind of question this is.  If you're not sure about
what rational numbers are, they're numbers you get when you divide one
integer by another, e.g., 

  1/2, 3/4, 17/19, 25/3, 48/6

and so on.  So what you're being asked is this:

  Is it possible to find two rational numbers that, when 
  subtracted, give an integer result?  

If it's possible, then the answer is 'sometimes', since it's clearly
possible to find examples (e.g., 1/2 and 2/3) for which the difference
is not an integer. 

If it's not possible, the answer is 'never'.  (There's no way for the
answer to be 'always'.  Do you see why?)

Does this help?
