Hi Sherly,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  While most homework problems are
solvable, most functions do NOT have antiderivatives that can be
written in "closed form," meaning that you can write them out in any
kind of nice way.  Yours is one of those functions, though proving
that this is so is not hard.  See also

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
