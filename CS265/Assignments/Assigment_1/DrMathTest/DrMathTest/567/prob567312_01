Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Some rhombuses are squares. However, in general, a rhombus is not a
square. One of the defining properties of a square is that adjacent
sides meet at right angles. This property is not mecessarily satisfied
by a rhombus.

A rhombus is any parallelogram with the property that all four sides
are congruent. Every square matches this description. Nothing in the
definition of a rhombus puts any restrictions on the angles. However,
the angles of a square must also be congruent (i.e. right angles). So,
most rhombuses will not be squares.

An example of this sort of idea is the following:

All Texans are Americans.
Not all Americans are Texans.

Substitute square for "Texan" and rhombus for "American", and it's the
same idea.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
