Many (actually, probably most) formulas have no antiderivative in 
terms of elementary functions.  That is, there is no formula involving
only powers, roots, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions,
and arithmetic operations, whose derivative is the given function.  
f(x) = e^(-x^2) is one of those.  It is the exception, not the rule,
that when given a continuous function f(x), you can find an elementary
function F(x) such that F'(x) = f(x).

The terminology of "first" and "second" fundamental theorems wasn't 
used when I learned the theorem.  The key is to consider a definite
integral as a function of its upper limit of integration.  Sometimes
this is called the "area accumulating function", using the 
interpretation of a definite integral as an area.  This function,
with the variable in the upper limit of integration, is an 
antiderivative of the integrand at every point where the integrand is
continuous.

Yes.  That symbolic formula is the best you can do.  There is no
explicit formula.
