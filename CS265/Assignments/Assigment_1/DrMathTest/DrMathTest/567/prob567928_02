Hello, Hannah --

From a purely mathematical standpoint, the function never becomes 
perfectly flat; and from a physical standpoint, the pendulum can't 
remain in motion forever.  So the function can't accurately model 
the motion forever.

If we ignore the "+0.71" at the end of the function, then my 
graphing calculator (TI-83) gives values for the function up until 
the function value is less than e^-100; but the graphing utility on 
the calculator flattens out to 0 a lot sooner than that.

I suppose we could imagine that the pendulum does in fact continue 
to oscillate forever but that its motion gets too small to 
measure....

I hope this helps some....
