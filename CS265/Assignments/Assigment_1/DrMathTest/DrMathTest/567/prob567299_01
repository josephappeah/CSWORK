Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Irene!

1) The domain is the set of values of x for which y = sec(x) has no
asymptote, so that sec(x) is defined there.

2) Your range is correct.

3) The period is the smallest value of p such that, for every x in
the domain of sec(x),

   sec(x+p) = sec(x).

Does that help?

4) There is no inverse function, because sec(x) = y has multiple
values of x for y = 1, x = Pi/2 and -3*Pi/2 both work.

In fact, no periodic function has an inverse function (do you see
why?).

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
