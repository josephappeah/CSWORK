Can you show me your work rather than just saying that you get a 
different answer than the book? I can't tell what sort of mistakes 
you are making unless I can see your work. Apart from this, I'll just 
be telling you what a textbook can tell you, and probably not as well.

Please show me how you set up the proportion for this problem. Then 
show me how you attempt to solve the proportion.
