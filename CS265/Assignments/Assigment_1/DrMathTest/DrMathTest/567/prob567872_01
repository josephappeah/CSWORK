Hello Jodi,

Let P be the time (in minutes) Peter takes to  mow the (entire) yard and C the time for 
Charles.

The first sentence says that P = C + 15.  For the second sentence, we note that Peter can 
do 1/P of the yard in one minute and Charles can do 1/C in one minute.  Together they 
can do 1/P + 1/C in 1 minute.  In 18 minutes they get the whole job done, that is,

18(1/P+1/C) = 1.

Now you have two equations in two unknowns.  It has two solutions but only one solution 
in which both P and C are positive.
