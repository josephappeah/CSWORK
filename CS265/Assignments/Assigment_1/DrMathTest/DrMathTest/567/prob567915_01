Hi Will,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Thinking of vectors as directed line
segments, we will use the notation v = <x,y,z> to denote the directed
line segment from the origin to the point with coordinates (x,y,z), 
then think about the additivity property like this.  Given two
vectors v1 = <x1,y1,z1> and v2 = <x2,y2,z2>, the values of the 
function f on them will be two new vectors u1 = f(v1) and u2 = f(v2).
[Incidentally, you seem to be discussing linear functions of three
variables, or equivalently, linear functions on three dimensional
space R^3, so you should use a notation such as f(x,y,z) or
f(<x,y,z>) instead of just f(x)].

You only mention real-valued functions, but the concept of a linear 
function is also defined for vector-valued functions of vectors.

You can add the vectors v1 and v2 using the usual parallelogram
addition, so that if we form a parallelogram with legs v1 and v2
(with a common base, say the origin), the sum v1+v2 is the vector 
from the origin to the opposite vertex.  Similarly, you can add 
u1 and u2, and the additivity property means that the value of f
on the sum v1+v2 will be the sum u1+u2 of the values of f on the 
individual vectors: f(v1+v2) = u1 + u2 .  in your examples, u1 and
u2 are just numbers. 

Given a vector v and a positive scalar c, the vector c*v is the 
vector parallel to v with magnitude c times the magnitude of v
(i.e. c times as long as v).  If c < 0, then the vector is parallel
to v but points in the opposite direction.  The homogeneity property
says that if f(v) = u, then f(2*v) = 2*u, f(3*v) = 3*u, etc.

Putting the two properties together, if you know the value of f on
two vectors which are not parallel, then you know the value of f on
the lines through the two vectors (each line consists of all scalar 
multiples of the vector), by the homogeneity property.  Then you also
know the value of f on the entire plane containing the two vectors,
since every point in this plane is a linear combination c1*v1+c2*v2
of v1 and v2: you can think of the two lines through v1 and v2, 
intersecting at the origin, as two skewed coordinate axes.  Given any
point in this plane, draw lines through the head of the vector 
parallel to v1 and to v2, and the lines will intersect the lines 
through v1 and v2, determining the multiples c1*v1 and c2*v2.  Then
the value of f on every vector in the plane determined by v1 and v2
is also determined, by the linearity properties.  The knowledge of
f on just three linearly independent vectors completely determines
all the values f(v), for all vectors v.

It is easy to see that your other examples are not linear.  For
example, if 

  f(x,y,z) = ax + bz + c,

and if you multiply the vector <x,y,z> by 2, the value of 

   f(2x,2y,2z) = a*(2x) + b*(2z) + c

               = 2ax + 2bz + c .

The first two terms have been doubled, but not the third, so
the result is NOT twice f(2x,2y,2z), which is 2ax + 2bz + 2c
(unless c=0, in which case f IS linear).

For f(x,y,z) = ax + bz^2, 

   f(2x,2y,2z) = a*(2x) + b*(2z)^2
               = 2ax + 4bz^2 ,

so the first term is doubled but the second term is quadrupled,
which is not twice the original value 2(ax+bz^2) = 2ax + 2bz^2.

You can also show that the additivity property fails for both 
examples.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
