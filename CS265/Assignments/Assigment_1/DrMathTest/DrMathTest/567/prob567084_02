It would have helped if you had explained how you got your tables, 
and how you were interpreting the grammar in each case. Your second 
solution seems to me to be based on reading the problem as

  Mary is 24 years old. Mary WAS twice as old as Ana when Mary 
  was as old as Ana is now. How old is Ana?

I don't see how "Mary IS twice as old as Ana was" can be interpreted 
as saying that Mary's age at the earlier time was twice Ana's age 
then. The first interpretation is correct.

If your second table is based on a different interpretation, let me 
know what it is and I will consider it.
