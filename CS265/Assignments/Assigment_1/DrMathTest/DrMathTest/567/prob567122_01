Hello, V.Sat Ash --

The area of the circle will not be less than the area of the 
triangles.  If you use an approximation for pi, or approximations in 
your calculations of the area of the triangles, then you might find 
that the area of the circle appears to be less -- but if you use 
adequate precision in your calculations, the combined area of the 
triangles must -- as you point out -- be less than the area of the 
circle.
