Hi Cim,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  There are often many ways to find 
an antiderivative, especially when trigonometric functions are 
involved.  In this case, there is one particularly simple approach.
Rewrite cos^3(x) as an expression in sin(x) times cos(x), and then
use the substitution u = sin(x).

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
