Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Jason!

Our Doctor Math Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) gives some useful
formulas:
  <http://www.mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.regpoly.html#8>

When you say 46" across, are you measuring between opposite corners, 
or between midpoints of opposite sides?  In the first case, you
have R = 46 and in the second case, you have r = 46.  In either
case, you want the value of a.

There are two ways to figure this out.  One is to draw the inscribed
and circumscribed circles, and radii to the corners and midpoints
of sides, and use trigonometry.  The other is to draw lines exten-
ding four of the sides to form an enclosing square, and use the
Pythagorean Theorem.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
