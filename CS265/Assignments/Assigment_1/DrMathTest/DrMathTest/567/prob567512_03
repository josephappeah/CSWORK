Hi Tim,

Suppose I have two points, (3,5) and (6,9).  The segment that connects
them is the hypotenuse of a right triangle.  One leg is the difference
in the x direction, which is just the difference of the x components:

  difference in x = |3 - 6|

The other leg is the difference in the y direction, which is just the
difference of the y components:

  difference in y = |5 - 9|

So now I put those into the Pythagorean Theorem:

  hypotenuse^2 = leg^2 + other_leg^2

    distance^2 = |3 - 6|^2 + |5 - 9|^2

                   ______________________
      distance = \/ |3 - 6|^2 + |5 - 9|^2

If you generalize this to two arbitrary points, (a,b) and (c,d),
you'll get a general formula for the distance between two points.  

Does this make sense?
