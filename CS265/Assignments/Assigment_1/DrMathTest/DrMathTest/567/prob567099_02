Hello Mathewzhao,

There's no magic.  The most general form of the equation of a plane is
A*x+B*y+C*z+D=0.  If we divide both sides by -D we find

(-A/D)*x + (-B/D)*y+(-C/D) = 1.

If we let a=-D/A, etc, then the equation becomes

x/a + y/b + z/c = 1.

If we set, for example, y=z=0, we are asking where the plane intersects the x-axis (on 
which y=z=0).  So,  x/a=1 and x=a is the place, the x-intercept.
