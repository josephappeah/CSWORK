Hi Darrell,

Thanks for writing to Doctor Math.

Multiple definitions are possible for most things, but it is best to 
use the simplest one. The way to get alternate definitions is by 
starting with a different property of the thing being defined.

Here is another possible definition of a circle. A circle consists 
of a point A, a point B not identical to A, and the locus of all 
points C such that angle ACB is 90 degrees.

From this definition you should be able to prove that there is a 
center point D such that the distance from D to any point on the 
circle is constant.

Does that make sense? Write again if you need more help.
