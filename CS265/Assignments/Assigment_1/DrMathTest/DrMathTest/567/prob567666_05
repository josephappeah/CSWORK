>the last thing- Do you have to add a decimal to 28?

Hi Michael, 

Thanks for clearing that up. 

You don't _have_ to add a decimal.  Sometimes you'll have an improper
fraction, where the numerator is larger than the denominator.  For
example, 
                  3
  15            ___
  --   -->    5 )15
   5             15
                 --
                  0

But in something like

         0.3
      __________
  72 ) 2 8.0 0 0
       2 1 6
       -----
         6 4 0    etc.

you have to include the decimal.  This makes some sense, since if you
divide something like 28 by something larger like 72, you have to end
up with something smaller than 1, right?
