Hi Praveen.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  Although AAA is indeed the 
same as AAA is the same as AAA..., this combination "AAA" is only
counted ONCE in the 36*36*36.

For another example, consider three spaces filled by numeric digits
0 through 9.  There are 10*10*10 of these:

  {000,001,002,...,010,011,012,...,998,999}

The combination "000" is only counted once.  This set includes
"100","010", and "001".

Does that clarify things?
