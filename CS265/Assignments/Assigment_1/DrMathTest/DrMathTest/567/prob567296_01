Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Robin!

Write

   a = d*q1 + s1,  0 <= s1 < |d|,
   b = d*q2 + s2,  0 <= s2 < |d|,
   a + b = d*q3 + s3,  0 <= s3 < |d|,
   a*b = d*q4 + s4,  0 <= s4 < |d|.

Then

   s1 = R_d[a],
   s2 = R_d[b],
   s3 = R_d[a+b],
   s4 = R_d[a*b],

by the definition of R_d.  The first statement you want to prove is
that

   s3 = R_d[s1 + s1].

Start with

   s3 = a + b - d*q3,
      = (d*q1 + s1) + (d*q2 + s2) - d*q3,
      = d*(q1+q2-q3) + s1 + s2,
   s1 + s2 = d*(q3-q1-q2) + s3,  0 <= s3 < |d|.

That implies that

   R_d[s1 + s2] = s3,

by the definition of R_d.  Q.E.D.

Make sure you understand each step and the reasons for it.

The other proof is similar.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
