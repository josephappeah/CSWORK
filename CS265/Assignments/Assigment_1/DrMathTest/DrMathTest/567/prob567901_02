Hi, Rachel & her Mom....

Certainly, if you want the product to be as small as possible, then 
the leading digits of the two numbers have to be the two smallest 
digits available to you.  So the smallest product will be either

  (1ab)*(2c)

or

  (2ab)*(1c)

where the digits abc are (in some order) 345.  This limits the 
possible solutions to a small group.

Specifically, the 2-digit number can only be one of the following:

  13, 14, 15; or 23, 24, 25

For each of these 2-digit numbers, the smallest product will be 
obtained using the smallest possible 3-digit number composed of the 
remaining digits, so there is only one possible 3-digit number for 
each of these 2-digit numbers.  We can then simply find the product 
for each of these possibilities and find which one is smallest:

  13*245 = 3185
  14*235 = 3290
  15*234 = 3510
  23*145 = 3335
  24*135 = 3240
  25*134 = 3350

The smallest product is

  13*245 = 3185

The title of your message calls this a "critical thinking" word 
problem; perhaps that means you are supposed to determine the answer 
without actually performing any multiplications.  It is possible to 
find the smallest product among the six possibilities above without 
doing the multiplications; however, that is another topic which will 
take a lot more time to explain.  So please write back if it is 
required to find the answer to this problem without performing the 
actual multiplications.
