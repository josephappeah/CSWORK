Hi James,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Perhaps two days ago was 30 Dec, and
she just turned 14 on 31 Dec, so she'll turn 15 at the very end of
"this" year, and that means she'll turn 16 at the very end of "next" year.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
