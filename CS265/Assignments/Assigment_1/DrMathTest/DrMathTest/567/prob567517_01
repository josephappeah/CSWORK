Hi Tryna,

That's not _such_ a bad situation to be in.  :^l

Let me ask you this:  How's your reading ability?  The reason I ask is
because if you have a textbook that you use for your math class,
you've got a tutor right there in your hand.  Just start reading the
book.  Everything the teacher - or a tutor - would tell you is in there.

I guess I'm a little confused.  If you find that math is really easy,
what is it that you need a tutor _for_?
