I answered this question from you a few days ago.  In case you 
didn't receive it I have copied it below:

If the average is 1 per 4 hours or 1/4 per hour, then in time t 
hours the average would be t/4.

The probability of no call P(0) in time t is  therefore e^(-t/4) 
using the Poisson probability function.

The probability  P(T>t) = prob.no events in time 0 -> t = e^(-t/4)

                 P(T<t) =  1 - e^(-t/4)

This is the c.d.f of the time to first event.

To get the p.d.f. we differentiate this and have 

      f(t) = (1/4).e^(-t/4)    This is pdf of time interval between 
events.

It is called the exponential distribution.

calculate the probability that the call 
>time 
>between one emergency cal to the next is
>(i) greater than 4 hours

 We saw above that P(T>t) = e^(-t/4)

                   P(T>4) = e^(-1)  =  0.36788

>(ii) less than 6 hours

    We saw also  P(T<t) = 1 - e^(-t/4)

                 P(T<6) = 1 - e^(-6/4) =  0.77687
