Hi, Andrew --

Mathematics is not all about finding the right formula.  Mathematics 
is about logical thinking.  Although the process of solving this 
problem is somewhat tedious, the procedure is straightforward.  You 
simply count the numbers of digits required to number each page 
until you have used 2989 digits.

Of course, you want to find some shortcuts for counting those 
digits....

(1) page numbers 1 to 9 (9 numbers) require 1 digit each
(2) page numbers 10 to 99 (90 numbers) require 2 digits each
(3) page numbers 100 to 999 (900 numbers) require 3 digits each
(4) page numbers 1000 to 9999 (9000 numbers) require 4 digits each
...
etc.

Some quick arithmetic shows that page numbers 1 through 999 together 
require most of the 2989 digits which were used.   You then only 
need to determine how many more digits were used and figure out how 
many 4-digit page numbers you have to have to use up the remaining 
digits.

One place you can easily stumble is the last step of determining the 
last page number.  If you find (for example) that 327 4-digit page 
numbers are required to use all 2989 digits, then the last page 
number is not 1327; it is 1326 -- because the first 4-digit number 
is 1000, not 1001.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
