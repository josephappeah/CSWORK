Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Jonathan!

There is no algebraic way to solve for x in terms of a, b, and k.
Even when numerical values are supplied for a, b, and k, such as
those in the example given, there is no way to solve.  The best
one can do is to solve numerically.  Clearly there is a root
between x = 1 and x = 2.  Checking 5^(1.5) + 9^(1.5), you can see
that the root must be between x = 1.5 and x = 2.  Next you'd try
x = 1.75, and see whether the root was smaller or larger, and so
whether the root lies in (1.5,1.75) or (1.75,2).  Continue this
until you have found the root to whatever accuracy you desire.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
