Hi,

Here's one:

  e = 2.71828...
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.e.html

You can find others by taking the square root of any integer that
isn't a perfect square, e.g., 
    _    _    _
  \/2, \/3, \/5, ..

By the way, note that 22/7 _will_ repeat; but it's just an
approximation to pi, not pi itself. 

Does this help?
