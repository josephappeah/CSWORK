Hi Donna,

Oh, I see.  So really that's just a different place to put the carries.

The idea with subtraction is that you are adding the negatives of the
numbers, so you really still have a sum, but SOME (and NOT all) of the
numbers are negative.  So you really have a sum with mixed signs.

So one idea is to sum all the negative numbers with the above method,
and then sum all the positive numbers (if there are more than one) and
then subtract the two sums using standard subtraction rules.

But you probably don't like that idea.  If you want to put it all
together, then you will have to treat each digit as having the sign
corresponding to the number it belongs to, as in

  +9272
  +5498
  -  27
  -2309
  -8565
  -----
  +4
   -2
    +8
    -11

and then when you add up the totals on the bottom, you still have to
do the borrowing.  You borrow a ten from the number above by
subtracting one from it (which makes a positive number smaller, but
makes a negative number a bigger negative):

  -----
  +3
   +8
    +6
     +9
  -----
   3869

Will that suit?  If you have any questions about this or need more
help, please write back and show me what you have been able to do, and
I will try to offer further suggestions.
