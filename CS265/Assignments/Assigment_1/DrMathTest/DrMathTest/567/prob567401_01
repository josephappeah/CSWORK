Hi Jenn,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Yes, the square root of 4 is 2, and 2
is  a natural number, so the square root of 4 is a natural numbers. 
And that makes 4 a "perfect square."

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
