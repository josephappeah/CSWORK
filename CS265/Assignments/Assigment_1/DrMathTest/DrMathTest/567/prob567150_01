Have you learned that the 1/2 power is the same as the square root of 
a number? Do you understand this?

If I can assume this, then the work goes as follows. Write the 
fraction as 3/2 = 3 * 1/2. Then apply the product property of 
exponents:

  8^(3*1/2) = (8^3)^(1/2)

or

  8^((1/2)*3 = (8^(1/2))^3

You can proceed either way. The second will give you smaller numbers 
to work with. Do you know how to simplify the square root of 8? 
That's what you have inside the parentheses. Once you have that, you 
will have to cube it. Then simplify the result once more.

If you can't get all the way through the problem with these 
suggestions, show me all the work you are able to do, and tell me 
what specifically confuses you so you can't go further.
