Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Sara!

You can rewrite this in the form

   cot(x) = 1 - x.

Equations of this kind cannot be solved algebraically.  Solutions
can sometimes be found by inspection, but in general, only numerical
solution is effective.  In this case, one can use Newton's Method
to find approximations to solutions.  From the graph, one can see
that there are infinitely many solutions: for each integer n, there
is one in the interval (n*Pi,[n+1]*Pi).

Pick a starting value x(0).  Then for each integer k >= 0, compute

   x(k+1) = x(k) - (x(k)-1+cot[x(k)])/(1-csc^2[x(k)]).

Then when x(k+1) and x(k) agree to the degree of accuracy desired,
you have the approximate solution sought.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
