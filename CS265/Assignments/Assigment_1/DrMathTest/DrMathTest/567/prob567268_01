Hi Jae,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  That's also the rule we have at

  Divisibility rules
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.divisibility.html

but the link for explanations at the bottom of that FAQ actually
refers to a different rule.

I would start by writing your number in the form

  10*a + b

where "a" is the "remaining numbers" and "b" is the last digit.  You
want to prove that

  7 divides (10*a + b) if and only if 7 divides (a - 2*b).

I would start by proving that

  7 divides (10*a + b) if and only if 7 divides (10*a - 20*b).

Does this help?  If you have any questions about this or need more
help, please write back and show me what you have been able to do, and
I will try to offer further suggestions.
