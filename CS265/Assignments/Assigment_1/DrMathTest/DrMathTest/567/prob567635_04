Hi Mathew,

That is the function which I was referring to in my reply, when I
mentioned the one-dimensional example.  However, since the function
above is only a function of one variable(x), you should write

>    f(x)=  {(x^2)sin(1/(x))             for x =/= 0
>           {            0                     x = 0  .

f(x) has a graph which oscillates between the curves y=x^2 and y=-x^2,
oscillating infinitely many times in every open interval containing
x=0, so you can't graph it near x=0.

f'(x) is a sum of two terms, one of the form c*x*sin(1/x), and one of
the form b*cos(1/x).  The first term does have a limit as x->0, but
the second one does not, so f'(x) is not continuous.  Again, because
of the infinitely many oscillations near the origin, you can't draw
a graph of f'(x) near x=0.  The cos(1/x) terms keeps oscillating 
between -1 and +1, faster and faster as x gets closer and closer to 0.

So f is differentiable on R, but f' is not continuous at x=0.
