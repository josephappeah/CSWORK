Hi Lil JJ,

You're on the right track.  There are 5,280 feet in a mile, so if you
can figure out how many quarters you need to make a row one foot long,
you can multiply by 5,280 to get the number you'd need to make a row a
mile long. 

One possible issue is whether you're stacking the quarters fact to face, 

   0)))))))

or edge to edge

   OOOOOOOOO

That's something you have to work out with the person who asked the
question.  Or you could just solve it both ways, to be safe.  :^D

Does this help?
