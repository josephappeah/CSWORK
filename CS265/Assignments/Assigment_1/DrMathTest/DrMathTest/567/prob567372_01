Hi, Liz --

Your answer is absolutely right!!  You are also correct in that the 
wording is confusing -- until you get used to it.

The absolute value of the difference between two numbers is the 
distance between the numbers, regardless of which one is larger.  
The difference between 5 and 2 is 3; and the difference between 2 
and 5 is 3:

  |5-2| ( = |3|) = 3
  |2-5| ( = |-3|) = 3

When we have an absolute value equation like

  |x-5| = 3

it means that "x" and "5" are 3 units apart on the number line -- in 
other words, "the difference between x and 5" is equal to 3.  
Clearly there are exactly two numbers which are 3 away from 5 on the 
number line -- one to the right (5+3=8) and one to the left (5-3=2).

To understand this interpretation of absolute value, I like to read

  |x-5|

as "the difference between x and 5".

Not much changes for inequalities.  If we have the inequality

  |x-5| < 3

it means that the difference between "x" and "5" is less than 3.  
Since the numbers 2 and 8 are exactly 3 units from 5, the solution 
to the inequality is all the numbers between 2 and 8.

Now let's look at your first example:

  "y is at most 2 units from 9"

Let's write this in the standard form

  "the difference between x and ? is ?"

It becomes

  "the difference between y and 9 is less than or equal to 2"

And we can translate this directly into absolute value notation as

  |y-9| <= 2

Your second example is

  "the distance between x and -10 is at least 6"

In this example, we don't need to change the sentence structure; we 
only need to change a couple of words:

  "the difference between x and -10 is greater than or equal to 6"

This translates directly into absolute value notation as

  |x-(-10)| >= 6

Note that the answer you show for this second example is not 
correct.  You show the answer being

  |x-(-10)| <= 6

In this answer the direction of the inequality is opposite what it 
should be.

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
