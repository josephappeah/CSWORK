The answer 2^8 - 1 would be correct if you included single letters 
as a combination.  This is because the number of combinations is 
decided by looking at each letter in turn and either including it or 
excluding it.  The -1 is there to remove the case of excluding every 
element.  If you exclude single letters then you must subtract 8 as 
well.  So the answer you want is

            2^8 - 9  = 247

Check this with just 3 letters A, B, C.  You showed that there were 
4 combinations, ABC, AB, AC, BC.  So applying opur formula we get

            2^3 - 4  =  8 - 4

                     = 4  (as required)
