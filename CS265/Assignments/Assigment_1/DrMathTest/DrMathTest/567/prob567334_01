Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Jojo!

Collinear means lying on the same line.  Since M and N lie on the
graph of Y = 4*X - 7, Q, R, or S will be collinear if and only if
they line on the same graph.  That happens if and only if the
coordinates of Q, R, or S satisfy that equation.

To test this, substitute the X- and Y-coordinates of the point into
the equation, and see if it gives a valid equality.  If so, the
point is on that graph, and if not, it is not.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
