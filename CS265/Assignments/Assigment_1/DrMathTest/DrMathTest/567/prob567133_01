Hi Mike,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Sometimes we write GF(q) to mean the
finite field with q elements.  Now when you speak of a polynomial of
degree k splitting in GF(2^k), you could mean:

  Every irreducible polynomial with coefficients in GF(2) (irreducible
over GF(2)) and degree k splits in GF(2^k).

Or you could mean:

  Every irreducible polynomial with coefficients in GF(2^k)
(irreducible over GF(2^k)) and degree k splits in GF(2^k).

I think you mean the first, which is true.  The second is NOT true.

The field obtained by adjoining a root (alpha) of your polynomial to
the field GF(2) is GF(2^k), and all such fields are isomorphic, which
means that every *other* irreducible polynomial in GF(2)[x] will also
split in the same extension field.

But if alpha is a root of your irreducible polynomial, then that does
NOT imply that alpha^2 is also a root of the same polynomial.  A
counterexample is easy to find, since most roots of most polynomials
will provide a counterexample.  (So you should look closer at your
proof and try to understand where it went wrong.)  That alpha^2 is in
the field GF(2)(alpha) is obvious because every field is closed under
multiplication.

Is that what you wanted to know?  If you have any questions about this
or need more help, please write back and show me what you have been
able to do, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
