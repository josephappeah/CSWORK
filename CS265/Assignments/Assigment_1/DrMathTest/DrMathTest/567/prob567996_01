Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Sarathi!

I am not familiar with the definition you give.  I learned that a
surd is an irrational real number.  For example,

   x^n - a = 0

has as its roots the nth roots of a.  If a is not a perfect nth
power, its real roots are irrational, and so are surds.  In the
example you gave, -1331 = (-11)^3, so it is a perfect cube.  It has
nothing to do with the sign, but with the perfect power property,
of -1331.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
