Hi Brittany,

I'm not sure what it is you're trying to find out.  You have an
expression with three variables.  What are you supposed to do with it?  

Right now, it's sort of like saying, 

  Bob has some money, and so does Tom, and so does Fred. 

But that's not really a problem, because it's not asking us to do
anything! 

What else can you tell me about the problem you're supposed to solve?
