Hi, Emma --

Doctor Jerry thinks this is a trick question.  I think it is simply 
a bad question.  It makes no sense grammatically.

When we say a temperature falls, it goes down; when we say a 
temperature rises, it goes up.  The amount it goes up or down is an 
absolute value; it is the difference between the two temperatures, 
without regard to sign.

A temperature can rise or fall by 4 degrees.  But it can't fall by 
negative 4 degrees, and it can't rise by a negative 4 degrees.
