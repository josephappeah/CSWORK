The remainder is always less than the divisor, so your answer cannot 
be right. What you've really got is 8.8, not 8 r 8. The two are the 
same only when the divisor is 10.

The remainder is what's left over after you've grouped everthing you 
can into groups the size of the divisor. We have 44 items, and group 
them into 8 groups of 5 each; there are 4 items remaining ungrouped. 
If you multiply the quotient (8) by the divisor (5) and add the 
remainder, you should get the dividend (44). 

Does this explanation help?
