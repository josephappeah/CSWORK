Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Nothing is wrong. x must be _strictly_ greater than 1/4 for the
inequality to be true. Using x = 1/4 should mean you get a false
statement (which you did). Using any value greater than 1/4 will work.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
