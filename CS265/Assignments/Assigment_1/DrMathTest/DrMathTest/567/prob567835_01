It sounds like you're not quite sure of the meaning of "postulate";
it's not something you can "solve", but a basic mathematical fact that
is assumed. You are probably learning to solve problems ABOUT the
"betweenness postulate". Does that sound right?

I would start by drawing a picture step by step to see how the points
are related. We start with two points T and V, so draw them (though we
don't know where they are, how far apart they are, or which is on the
right, so we can't be sure our picture is right):

  T-----------V

Now S is between them (somewhere), so it looks something like this,
ignoring relative distances):

  T---S-------V

Now R is between S and T, so add that to the picture, and so on. Then
label the lengths you know, and see what they tell you.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back. Show me
what you've been able to do.
