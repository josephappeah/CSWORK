Hi Ashkan,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It is easy to prove that R > S except
for very small values of x and y, or very small values of n.  So you
can easily check all of the cases of your theorem in order to prove
it.  Do you know how to do that?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
