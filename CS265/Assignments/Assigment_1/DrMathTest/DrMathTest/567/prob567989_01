Hi Bjarke,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  I'm not sure what you are thinking
of, but there is no mathematical problem with multiplying 0 by 0.
0*a = 0 for any real (or even complex) number a, and a=0 in 
particular.  This isn't hard to prove from the usual properties for
arithmetic.

0/0 is undefined, and 0! is defined to be 1 as a convenience: 
otherwise you have to write the term for index 0 as a separate 
term in many infinite series.  0^0 is more of a problem, since there
are reasons for defining it to be 0 (0^x = 0 for any x > 0), and
reasons for defining it to be 1 (x^0 = 1 for all x not equal to 0).
There seems to be a consensus now that 0^0 = 1 is better.  See

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.divideby0.html
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.0factorial.html

and

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.0.to.0.power.html .

You can find more archived answers by searching with the keywords

   0/0
   0!
   0^0  ,

which produced the results above, among many others.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
