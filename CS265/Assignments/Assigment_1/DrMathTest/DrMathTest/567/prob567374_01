Hello Jade,

There are probably lots of equivalent ways to define this, but one
is this:

"A terminating decimal is a decimal expansion for a number which
has only a finite number of non-zero digits."

In other words, after a certain point in the expansion, all the rest of
the decimal values are zero.

Here's another, equivalent, definition:

"A terminating decimal is a decimal expansion for a number that is
exactly equal to a fraction with an integer numerator and a denominator
that is an integer power of 10."
