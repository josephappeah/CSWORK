Hi guys,

That's not something you can really 'prove', although it is something
you can test.

Pick up any physics book, and you should find things like 

  Force = mass * acceleration

or equations that will tell you how the mass and length of a pendulum
will affect the period with which it swings.

Going to Google and searching for 'physics experiments', I found this
site, 

  http://freespace.virgin.net/gareth.james/virtual/

and I'm sure there are lots more like it.  

But wouldn't it be more interesting to actually approach the situation
the way a scientist would?  That is, guess that there's some
relationship among two or more quantities, collect data, and then try
to figure out what equation governs the relationship?  Just testing an
equation that someone else has already figured out doesn't seem like
that much fun...
