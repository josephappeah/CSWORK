Hi Nicole,

If you raise anything to the first power, you just get that thing
back.  It's sort of like multiplying by 1.  That is, 
 
   1
  a  = a

For more about exponents, take a look at

  Properties of Exponents
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57293.html

and write back if it's not clear, or if you still have questions. 

Does this help?
