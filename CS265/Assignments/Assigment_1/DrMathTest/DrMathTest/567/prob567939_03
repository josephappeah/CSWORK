I've seen "septagon" used, though I don't think it's in dictionaries, 
and certainly not "sexagon". I actually hadn't thought about there 
being a problem with "hexadecimal" having mixed roots. (Base 60, 
however, is "sexagesimal", which comes straight from Latin.) But I 
notice I have mentioned this myself (in a quote from another site):

  Names of Bases (Octal, Hexadecimal, etc.)

Here is a deeper discussion:

Your comments on element names are interesting; I've never looked 
into the origin of what I consider to be an ugly system that is 
acceptable only because it is deliberately temporary! I don't know 
whether it is done that way to make the symbols work, or just because 
those are the first prefixes someone thought of; but your suggestion 
makes sense.
