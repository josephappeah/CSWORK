Hi Charles,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  So you have

  x/f = f/k + C,

and you don't know what to do about the C.  Well, if you solve this
for f (using the quadratic equation), you can get a formula for f(x)
in terms of x, k, and C.  Then you can substitute x=0 into this
formula, and you will find that half of the solutions satisfy the
given initial condition, which means that you can still choose just
about anything for C and still satisfy the initial condition.  In
other words, the initial condition f(0)=0 doesn't uniquely determine
the function f(x).

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
