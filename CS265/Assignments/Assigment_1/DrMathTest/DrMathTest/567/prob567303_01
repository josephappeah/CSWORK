Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math. 

Let's address these issues one at a time:

You should _always_ keep track of units in these problems:

   42 laps / 30.82 min = 1.36 laps/min

So, this figure tells you that you swim over 1 lap a minute (actually,
a little more than a lap and a third in a minute).

>d/t=r 
>2.2/27.92=.0788  I'm not sure what that means, but it looks like I'm 
>a lot faster than I think ;-)

Again, units:

   2.2 miles / 27.92 min = 0.0788 miles/min

This means you run 0.0788 miles every minute. Converting to miles per
hour, it is 4.728 miles per hour.

>27.92/2.2=12.12.69 - which also agrees better with my watch

This calculation is:

   27.92 min / 2.2 miles = 12.69 minutes / mile

So, it takes 12.69 minutes to run a mile.

>Biking:  12 miles in 57.5 minutes
>
>d/t=r
>
>12/57.5=.21  (do I really bike a sub minute mile?)

Units:

   12 miles / 57.5 minutes = 0.21 miles / minute = 12.52 miles per hr.

>57.5/12=4.79  (so I bike a 4.79 minute mile)

   57.5 minutes / 12 miles = 4.79 minutes per mile

Speed is given as distance per unit time. So, your _speed_ is 12.52
miles per hour. You are also interested in the time it takes to travel
certain intervals (laps/miles). This is a slightly different
calculation from speed.
