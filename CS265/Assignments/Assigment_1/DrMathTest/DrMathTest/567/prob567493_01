Hi, Tammy --

41 students are taking French and 22 are taking German.  If we count 
all of those students together, we get 41+22=63 students.

But 9 students are taking both French and German; our count of 63 
students includes those students twice.  So the actual number of 
students taking one or both of the languages is 63-9=54.

Then, since there are 78 students in the class, of which 54 are 
taking at least one of the two languages, the number not enrolled in 
either language is 78-54=24.
