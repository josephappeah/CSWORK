Hi, Tina --

Your description of how you got your answer is too brief for me to 
know exactly how you got your answer.  I suspect you did a lot more 
work than you needed to.

If each bunny alive at the beginning of each year has 7 bunnies that 
year, the total number of bunnies will get multiplied by 8 each year:

1st year:  start with 1; add 7 -- total is 8

2nd year:  start with 8; add 7*8 -- total is 8*8

3rd year:  start with 8*8; add 7*(8*8) -- total is 8*(8*8)

and so on.

So the total number of bunnies at the end of the 3rd year is just 
8^3 = 8*8*8 = 512.
