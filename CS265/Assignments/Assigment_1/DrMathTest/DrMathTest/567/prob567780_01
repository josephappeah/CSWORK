The expression "abc" means "the product of the values of the variables
a, b, and c". So you are correct: to evaluate it with the three given
values, you multiply those values; and the way to write that
algebraically is to replace each variable with its value (in
parentheses so that the mixed numbers don't get mixed up):

  when a= 4/7, b= 1 1/6, and c= 3,

  abc = (4/7)(1 1/6)(3) = ...

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
