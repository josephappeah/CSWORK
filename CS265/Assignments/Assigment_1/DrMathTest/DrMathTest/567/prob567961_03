Hi Patmanathen,

There isn't any simple way to understand this problem and how to solve
it other than understanding and using the logarithm properties.

Where do you have difficulty in writing

   log base b (xy^3)=m

in terms of log_b(x) and log_b(y)?  That is a straightforward 
application of logarithm properties, and you have to understand those
before you can make any progress on this problem.
