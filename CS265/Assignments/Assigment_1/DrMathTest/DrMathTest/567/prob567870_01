Hello Goofymad,

A book must be the best source.  Many things in mathematics are best understood by a 
careful exposition, going through each step.  I doubt if there is such an explanation on the 
web.

However, I just did a search in Google, with the keyword    decimals.  I got several hits that 
look interesting.
