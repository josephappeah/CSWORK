Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Heidi!

Assuming he rides no horse twice, this is how to figure that out.
How many ways can he choose the first horse to ride?  For each of
those choices, how many ways can he choose the second horse?  For
each pair of those choices, how many ways can he choose the third
horse?  The last horse leaves only one possible choice.  Multiply
those numbers together to get the answer.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
