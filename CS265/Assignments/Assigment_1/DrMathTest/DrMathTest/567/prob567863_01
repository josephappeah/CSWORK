Hi,

The following answers from the Dr. Math archive contain information 
relevant to your question: 

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/54133.html
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/54962.html
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55132.html

I found them by searching on these keywords (with "whole words" 
checked, to avoid the word "horizontal"):

  horizon distance

You can do the same search, or a different one if you wish, by going 
to

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
