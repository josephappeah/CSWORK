Hi Lauren,

Do you mean 

   c+3
  x
  ---- ?
   c-3
  x

If so, you need to use parentheses to contain the exponent, 

  x^(c+3)/x^(c-3)

The way you wrote it, it means

   c
  x  + 3
  ------
   c
  x  - 3

and there's not much you can do with that.  

The property you need to know is that

   b
  a     b-c
  -- = a
   c
  a

You can find out why this works (and get a quick introduction to lots
of other things you'll need to know about exponents) here:

Write back if it's not clear, or if you still have questions.
