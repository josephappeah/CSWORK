Hi KJ,

I'm not sure exactly what you're asking, but it looks to me like long 
division.

I think the following answer from the Dr. Math archive will tell 
you what you want to know: 

  Long Division

I found it by searching on these keywords:

  long division

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
