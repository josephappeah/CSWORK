Hello Kathryn,

You can see

http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.prism.html

The "1" you see there is intended to be a small "ell."    I'll use L for the "height" of the 
prism.  So, letting S be the LATERAL SURFACE AREA,

S = L*P,

where P is the perimeter.  In this case P = 2W+2B, where W and B are the width and 
breadth of the rectangular base.

If the prism is standing on its rectangular base, then each  base is W*B.  So,

total surface area = 2W+2B+2W*B.

I may not have understood exactly what a rectangular prism is.  I took it as the bases are 
rectangles.
