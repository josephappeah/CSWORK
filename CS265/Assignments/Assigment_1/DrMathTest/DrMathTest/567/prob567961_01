Hi Patmanathen,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Just use logarithm properties to
rewrite the given logarithm statements as a linear system in log_b(x)
and log_b(y).  For example, the first equation 

>given log base b (xy^3)=m ....

can be rewritten using log_b(u*v) = log_b(u)+log_b(v), and
log_b(u^n) = n*log_b(u).  You can solve for log_b(x) and log_b(y),
and then it is easy to determine log_b(sqrt(xy)) (after rewriting
this expression in terms of log_b(x) and log_b(y)).

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
