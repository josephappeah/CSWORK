The formula you quote is for the number of regions if there are n 
points round a circle and every point is joined to every other 
point.  The number of chords is a very different problem, because in 
general the ends of chords will not meet the ends of other chords.  
In fact if you simply say the number of chords you can get a variety 
of answers depending on how the chords are drawn.  For exampe, with 
two chords it is possible to have 3 regions if they don't intersect 
each other and 4 regions if they do intersect.

Check again that you are talking about n points distributed round a 
circle and not about n chords.  If it is about n points the formula 
you quote is correct, if it is about n chords the answer is 
indeterminate.

If you have 50 chords the answer is anyone's guess.  If you have 50 
points distributed round the circle the answer is

   1 + C(50,2) + C(50,4)

  = 1 + 1225 + 230300

  =  231526


C(n,r) is the number of combinations of r things that can be made 
from n different things. 

                      12 x 11 x 10 x 9
  Example  C(12,4)  = ----------------  =  495
                       1 x 2 x 3 x 4
