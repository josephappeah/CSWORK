Let's forget about variables for a moment, and look at a case
involving numbers. Do you see why we can write

  15 - 10 

as 

  5*3 - 5*2 = 5(3 - 2) ?

Now, suppose instead of 15 and 10, we have 

  5a - 5b

where it might be the case that a=3 and b=2, but they might have other
values instead.  Could you follow the same pattern as above with this
expression?  Try it and let me know what you come up with.
