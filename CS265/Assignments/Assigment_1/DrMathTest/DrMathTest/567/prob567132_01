Hi Emirhan,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Such a sequence is called a 
"geometric sequence" or "geometric series".  To see why your first
equation is true, and to find the answer to your second question,
see

   http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeometricSeries.html .

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
