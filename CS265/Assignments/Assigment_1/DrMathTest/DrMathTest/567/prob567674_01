Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

It often helps to think about examples to clarify a situation. It is
possible for P(A|B) to be greater than P(A), especially if B is highly
correlated with A. For example, think about a roulette wheel. You know
that the probability of correctly guessing a number at roulette is
1/19. But, let's say you know (because you are psychic or because
somebody is cheating) that the ball will land on one of the numbers
1-12. Then, the probability of correctly guessing a number is 1/12.

   A - correctly guessing a roulette result
   B - knowing somebody is cheating or you are psychic

  A|B - correctly guessing a roulette result because you have
additional knowledge

Because you have the additional knowledge, it is easier for you to
guess the roulette result. So, P(A|B) > P(A) in this case. Additional
information always helps, at the very least. So, P(A|B) is always
greater than or equal to P(A). It is only equal to P(A) when the
additional information doesn't really help. 

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
