Hi Christian,

I realized that I can say more about your series.  You see, I thought
that it might be hard to prove that every sequence will end in a loop
because your problem reminded me of the Collatz 3n+1 Problem, as
described in

  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CollatzProblem.html

In this problem, which is very similar to yours, there is only one
loop, and no one has ever been able to prove that EVERY number will
end up there.

But when I though about your problem a little more, I realized that
because yours can't grow as fast as Collatz, it is actually not very
hard to prove that every sequence ends in a loop.  So allow me to do
that for you:

Suppose we start with some number, and then we transform it according
to your rule.  What is the smallest number that we might ever get in
our sequence?  Call it n.  Can it be even?  No.  Then the next two
numbers are n+9 and (n+9)/2, and these can't be smaller than n, which
means that our sequence must contain a number from 1 to 9.  How do we
know that there is a smallest number?  Since these are all positive
integers, they can't just keep getting smaller.  That is, the first
number is fixed, so you just have to ask which of the (finitely many)
smaller numbers are in the sequence.  Take the smallest one.  So
really the proof is just like what I described in my last email.
