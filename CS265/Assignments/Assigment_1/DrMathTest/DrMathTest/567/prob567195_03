Hello again, David --

Again there are many pages in the Dr. Math archives where you can 
find discussions of the process for converting the decimal part of a 
fraction to other bases.  Here are several links which appear 
particularly good:

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/64392.html
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55744.html
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55729.html

Here is a demonstration of the process, converting your example of 
0.6 to binary.  Basically, we simply take the given decimal fraction 
and, using base-10 arithmetic, repeatedly multiply by the new base 
(2) and pick off the whole number parts:

  .6 * 2 = 1.2
  .2 * 2 = 0.4
  .4 * 2 = 0.8
  .8 * 2 = 1.6
  .6 * 2 = 1.2
  ...

At this point, just as with decimal fractions, we see the pattern is 
starting to repeat -- so we know that

  .6 (base 10) = .1001 1001 1001 ... (base 2)

We can check this result using our knowledge about the sum of 
infinite geometric series.  We have

  1001 (base 2) = 9 (base 10)

So the repeating decimal

  .1001 1001 1001 ... (base 2)

is equivalent to, in base 10, the infinite geometric series

  9/16 + (9/16)*(1/16) + (9/16)*(1/16)^2 + ...

  = (9/16)/(1-(1/16))

  = (9/16)/(15/16)

  = 9/15

  = 3/5

  = .6

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you still have any 
questions about any of this.
