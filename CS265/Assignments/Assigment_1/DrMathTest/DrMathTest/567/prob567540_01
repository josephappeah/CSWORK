Hi Don.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

The formula for the area of a square relates the area A to the
side length S:

  A = S x S.

If A=10 acres, then S=660 ft.  This is because 660 ft x 660 ft =
435600 sq ft = 10 acres.  If A = 20 acres = 871200 sq ft, then 
you have to find the value for S such that

  871200 ft = S x S,

and perform a similar calculation for

  40 acre =  1742400 sq ft = S x S.

Let us know if you still have trouble with this.
