Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The combinations formula only applies if order does not matter. In
other words, there's only 1 way of arranging the 6 letters A, B, C, D,
E, and F if you don't care about the order of the letters. So:

   ABCDEF

and

   FEDCBA

are counted as the same thing.

You want the permutation formula:

    nPr = n!/(n-r)!

which gives you the number of _permutations_ of the 6 letters (where
order _does_ matter).

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
