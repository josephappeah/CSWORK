Hi Tan,

Well, in one direction, this is easy:  If p = 2, 3, or 5, then just
substitute that into (p-1)! + 1 and see that you have a power of p.

The other direction is harder:  Showing that if (p-1)! + 1 is a power
of p, then p is either 2, 3, or 5.

>[Difficulty]
>The confuxing thing is that is p^[(p-1)!+1]=p ?

No, that's not at all what they said.  To say (p-1)! + 1 is a power of
p means that

  (p-1)! + 1 = p^k

for some integer k.

So you want to assume that (p-1)! + 1 is a power of p and try to prove
that p is either 2, 3, or 5.

>[Thoughts]
>the hint is that if (n-1)^k divides (n^k-1) then (n-1) divides k.

Yes, except for k=1.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
