Hi, Albert -

Let me just get you started on one of these so you can see the 
process....

(1) write the fraction as a sum of separate fractions, each one with 
a denominator which is one of the factors in the original 
denominator; the numerators of these fractions are to be determined:

     7x+11      A     B
  ---------- = --- + ---
  (x+5)(x-3)   x+5   x-3

(2) multiply everything through by the common denominator; 
everything in the denominator cancels on the left; on the right one 
of the factors cancels in each fraction:

  (x+5)(x-3)(7x+1)   A(x+5)(x-3)   B(x+5)(x-3)
  ---------------- = ----------- + -----------
     (x+5)(x-3)          x+5           x-3

  7x+1 = A(x-3) + B(x+5)

(3) expand and collect like terms:

  7x + 1 = Ax - 3A + Bx + 5B
  7x + 1 = (A+B)x + (-3A+5B)

(4) make two equations in the two unknowns A and B by equating the 
coefficients of x and the constant terms on the two sides of the 
equation:

  7 = A+B
  1 = -3A+5B

(5) solve this pair of equations by your favorite method....

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
