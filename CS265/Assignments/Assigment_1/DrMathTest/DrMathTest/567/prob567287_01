Hi Steph,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Here are a few tricks that I use for multiplying two 2-digit numbers:

1) if one number is divisible by 5, multiply it by 2, then divide the 
answer by 2.  For example:

  45 x 81

I would change to

  (90 x 81)/2

2) If one number ends in a 9, then add 1 to it and subtract the other 
number from your answer:

  69 x 47

is equal to:

  (70 x 47) - 47

You can also do the opposite:

  51 x 83

is equal to:

  (50 x 83) + 83

And you can even add 2 or subtract 2:

  62 x 77

Is equal to:

  (60 x 77) + (2 x 77)

And

  28 x 66

is equal to:

  (30 x 66) - (2 x 66)

This won't solve every 2-digit problem for you, but it should get you 
through most of them.  If you are able to do all of these kinds of 
problems, I think that you should be ok with the mental math you're 
going to see.  (This is all the mental math I ever needed in high 
school and college.)

I will leave this problem where other math doctors can look at it and 
offer their own ideas.
