Hi Jennifer,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Do you mean how do you write that on
the computer?  We usually write it as

  6*y^5

or just

  6y^5

where the carat (^) means an exponent.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
