Hello Emma,

In my opinion, this is something close to a trick question.  However,  if a temperature x is 
given and someone says that the temperature falls by y, they mean that the new 
temperature is x-y.  If y is negative, like -4 C, and x=-2, then

x-y=-2-(-4) = -2+4=2

To fall by a negative amount is to rise.  Two negatives give a positive.
