Hi,

With a function of one variable, the derivative tells you the slope of
the tangent to the function at any point. But consider a function of
two variables.  This describes a surface, and at any point on the
surface, the slope of the tangent would depend on the direction
in which we're moving, wouldn't it?  So if we'd like to compute a
derivative at a point, what do we want it to tell us? 

One thing we might do would be to figure out the direction normal to
the surface, use that to define a tangent plane, and then define a
single 'slope' for that plane.  The problem with this is that it
doesn't extend naturally to higher dimensions. 

Another thing we might do would be to to choose a direction, and then
compute the slope as we head in that direction.  Some natural
directions to choose would be the dimensions of the various axes of
the coordinate frame that we're operating in.  That is, we can say: 
Suppose we hold y fixed (or y and z and u and v and ...), and allow x
to vary.  What slope do we get?

That's basically a partial derivative.  And in fact, when computing a
partial derivative with respect to one variable, we just stop looking
at the other variables as variables for a moment, and start looking at
them as constants.  For example, if we have

  z = x^2 y^3

to find the partial derivative with respect to x, we assume y is
constant, so 

  @z        d
  -- = y^3 -- x^2
  @x       dx

     = y^3 * 2x

and 

  @z        d
  -- = x^2 -- y^3
  @y       dy

     = x^2 * 3y

Does this help?
