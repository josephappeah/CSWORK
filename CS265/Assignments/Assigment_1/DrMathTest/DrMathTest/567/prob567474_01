Hi Jenene,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The colon (x:16) is often used to mean
a ratio, and you should think of it as divide, since that's what ratio
is.  I usually see

  x:16 = 5:10,

with an equal sign, but that's probably what they meant by the double
colon (::).  They probably meant is to be read "x is to 16 as 5 is to
10," which should be written mathematically as

  x/16 = 5/10.

Does that help?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
