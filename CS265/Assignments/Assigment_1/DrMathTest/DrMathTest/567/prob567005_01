Hi Tina,

It's often a mistake to try to jump right to a formula.  Let's just
start with this:

  Total receipts were $824.

What does this tell us?  It tells us that

  824 = (receipts for adults) + (receipts for students)

Does that make sense?  Now we want to find some way to represent the
two amounts on the right.  The receipts for adults would be 

  receipts for adults = no. of adult tickets * price of adult ticket

We know the price of an adult ticket is $3, so we can shorten this to 

  receipts for adults = no. of adult tickets * 3

Looking back to our equation, we have

  824 = (no. of adult tickets * 3) + (receipts for students)

Can you do the same thing for the second term?  Try that, and let me k
know what you come up with.
