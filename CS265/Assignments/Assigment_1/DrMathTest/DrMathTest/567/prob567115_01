Amanda,

You are correct, the greatest integer function does not have origin symmetry; indeed, it 
does not have any rotational or reflection symmetry.

A function y = f(x) has rotational symmetry about the origin if and only if for all x in the 
domain,

     f(-x) = -f(x).

We call such a function "odd."  If there is but one x that fails to satisfy this criterion, the 
function is not odd.

Let us call the greatest integer function Floor[x].  Then

     Floor[1.5] = 1,
     Floor[3.9999] = 3,
     Floor[-0.25] = -1,
     Floor[100] = 100.

And we then have

     Floor[-1/2] = -1,

whereas

     -Floor[1/2] = -(0) = 0.

Thus there is at least one x for which Floor[-x] is not equal to -Floor[x], and the greatest 
integer function is not odd.

Interestingly, about the point (x,y) = (1/2,0), the greatest integer function is "almost 
everywhere" rotationally symmetric.  That is,

     Floor[1/2 - x] = -Floor[x + 1/2]

for ALMOST every x.  For which values of x is this equation false?
