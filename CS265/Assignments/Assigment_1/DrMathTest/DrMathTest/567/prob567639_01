Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Lee!

For any fixed value of z, y is proportional to x.  That means that
for all x, y = c(z)*x, where c(z) depends on z but not x.

Now for any fixed value of x, y is proportional to z.  That means
that for all z, y = z*k(x), where k(x) depends on x but not on z.
Putting these together, for all x and z,

   z*k(x) = y = c(z)*x,

Now pick some value of x, such as x = 1.  Then for all z,

   c(z) = c(z)*1 = z*k(1).

Substituting, we have that for all x and z,

   y = x*z*k(1) = (constant)*x*z.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
