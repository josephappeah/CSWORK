Hi Karen,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  In your original equation,
notice that y^2 and y have different signs:

   9x^2 - y^2 + 2y - 10 = 0 .

But when you complete the square, you get an expression

  >9x^2 - (y+1)^2  = 11

in which the y^2 and y terms on the left side will have the same
sign, so this is not correct.

The problem is that you are not being sufficiently careful with
signs: you need to write

  9x^2 - y^2 + 2y - 10 = 9x^2 - (y^2 - 2y) - 10 

and now complete the square inside the parentheses (adjusting 
outside the parentheses for the addition you perform inside to
complete the square).

If you have any questions or need further help, please write back
and show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further
suggestions.
