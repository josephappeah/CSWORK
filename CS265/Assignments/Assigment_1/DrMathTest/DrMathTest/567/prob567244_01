Hi, Shonda --

There are many ways of finding the area of a triangle.  The easiest 
one is

  area = one-half base times height

But in your case, we aren't given the height, so this formula won't 
help us.  (Actually, because two of the sides of your triangle are 
the same length, we could determine the height of the triangle and 
use that formula.  But I think you want a general formula for the 
are in terms of the lengths of the three sides.

Here it is, in all its glory:

  area = square root of ((s)(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides and s is the 
semi-perimeter

  s = (a+b+c)/2

It looks ugly, but it's not too bad to work with.  The primitive 
calculator that is on your PC is all you need to use the formula.

In your example, we have

  a=50, b=50, c=5

  s = (a+b+c)/2 = 105/2 = 52.5

  s-a = 2.5
  s-b = 2.5
  s-c = 47.5

And the formula gives us

  area = square root of ((52.5)(2.5)(2.5)(47.5)) = 124.843652...

Note this is a reasonable answer.  The triangle is very tall and 
skinny; its height is only a tiny bit less than the length of each 
of the two long sides.  If the height were exactly 50, then the 
elementary formula using base and height would give us

  area = (1/2)(5)(50) = 125

Since the height is a tiny bit less than 50, the area is a tiny bit 
less than 125, so our answer is reasonable.

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any questions 
about any of this.
