Hi Meaghan,

Is the problem that you're unclear on the concept of what a square
root _is_?  Or are you just trying to find out how to compute them by
hand?  

If it's the latter, take a look at

  Square/cube roots without a calculator
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.sqrt.by.hand.html

If it's the concept, write back and we can talk more about that. 

Does this help?
