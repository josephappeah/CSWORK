Hi Jessica,

I'm not quite sure what you're asking.  Is the problem just that the
numbers are in cm, and you'd like to know the equivalent measurements
in inches?

As a rule of thumb, there are about 2.5 cm in an inch, so

  4 cm by 2 cm by 2.5 cm

would be

  about 1.5 inches by a little less than an inch by an inch

which is about as big as the end of a typical thumb. 

To visualize this, you could try cutting something that size out of a
block of cheese.

There are 10 mm in a cm, so 

  4 mm by 2 mm by 2.5 mm

would be

  about .15 inches long by a little less and .1 inch by .1 inch

which is about the size of an apple seed.  Quite a bit smaller!

Does this help?  Or have I misunderstood your question?
