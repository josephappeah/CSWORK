Good start:

  2x    7          7
  -- * -- = x^2 * --
   7   2x         2x


            7 * x^2
        1 = -------
              2x

Correct.

Well, not quite.  What about the 2? 

>So it will be 1=7x.  

Or 1 = 7x/2.  :^l

>Divide both sides by 7x

The problem with your strategy is that it misses one of the possible
solutions.  Here's a different way to approach it:

  2x
  -- = x^2
   7
 
             2x
   0 = x^2 - --              It's often nice to have zero on one 
              7              side of an equation, because then we
                             can multiply the other by anything
                             we want. 

   0 = 7x^2 - 2x             Multiply both sides by 7. 

   0 = x(7x - 2)             Factor out an x.

Now, at this point it's useful to note that the ONLY way to get a
product of zero is if at least one factor is zero.  So for this
equation to be true, at least one of the following must be true:

  1) x = 0

  2) 7x - 2 = 0

The first condition is trivial.  The second is true when x = 2/7.  So
there are two values that satisfy the original equation. 

The moral of the story is that while it's always a good idea to cancel
constants (like 2 or 7), you have to be very, very careful when
canceling variables or variable expressions:

Does this help?
