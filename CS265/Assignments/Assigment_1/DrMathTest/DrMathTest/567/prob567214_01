Hi Jocelyn,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  I have no idea why you are adding
2*pi to the equation.  You hae been asked to solve an equation, and
this changes the equation you are to solve.  You may be getting
confused about using periodicity, since trigonometric functions
are periodic, which means that if you know a solution x0 of

   sin(x) = c   for some number c, then

sin(x0+2*pi) = c  also, as does  sin(x0+4*pi), sin(x0+8*pi), etc.

But you should never change the equation you are given.  That is the
equation you need to solve.

Perhaps the problem will be clearer is you write y = tan(@)  (I am 
using @ for theta), so that the original problem is

   3y^2 - 1 = 0 .

What are the solutions to this equation?  (y = ? )

Once you have a solution to this equation, say y = r, then you
need to solve

   tan(@) = r.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
