Hi Lee,

But wouldn't you just be moving the sides of the box to other
locations?  That wouldn't really get you out of three dimensions,
would it?

Can I make a suggestion?  If you're really interested in thinking
about this, an excellent place to start is by looking at the book
_Flatland_, by E.A. Abbott, which discusses (in a very entertaining
way) how three-dimensional objects would be perceived by
two-dimensional beings.  

You don't even need to go to the library, because it's available for
free online:

Does this help?
