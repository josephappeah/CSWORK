Hi,

The possible score is 100 points, which has to be equal to the sum of
the points for the 5-point questions, and the sum of the points for
the 12-point questions.  Does that make sense?  

So

  100 = (pts for 5-pt questions) + (pts for 12-pt questions)
        
Okay, so how do we figure out those two things on the right?  Well,
suppose we know that there are N 5-point questions.  Then the number
of points for those questions would be

  pts for 5-pt questions = N * 5 pts

right?  So we have

  100 = (N * 5) + (pts for 12-pt questions)

So what about the 12-point questions?  Again, we want the number of
questions, times the value of each question (12 points).  So what is
the number of questions?

Well, if there are 13 questions in all, and N of them are worth
5-points, then (13-N) of them must be worth 12 points.  (Try a few
values:  If N = 1, there is 1 5-point question, and 12 12-point
questions.  If N = 2, there are 2 5-point questions, and 11 12-point
questions.  And so on.)

Can you take it from here?
