Hi Koh,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  This is where your study of 
trigonometric identities becomes useful.  Remember that when you
find the indefinite integral of a function, you add the "constant
of integration".  In this case, since

   cos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x) ,

(-1/2)cos(2x) + C   is equivalent to  sin^2(x) + C, since the two
terms differ only by a constant.  You can use either expression (with
the constant of integration) as the indefinite integral of sin(2x).

If you have any questions, please write back and I 
will try to explain further.
