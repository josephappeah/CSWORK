Hi, Carla --

Yes!!  That's exactly right.

It doesn't matter if you are working in 2 dimensions or three 
dimensions.  If the ratio of any measurement of lengths in two 
similar figures is x:y, then the ratio of any measurement of areas 
in those figures is x^2:y^2 -- and if you are in 3 dimensions, then 
the ratio of any measurement of volumes in those figures is x^3:y^3.
