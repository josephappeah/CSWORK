Hello Ken,

If you substitute y=g(z) in x=f(y), you will find x=f(g(z)).  So, x is a function of z.  
Depending upon f and g, the derivative dx/dz exists and is equal to

dx/dz = (dx/dy)*(dy/dz).

Another way of expressing this is in functional notation:

Let

h(z) = f(g(z)).

Then

h`(z) = f`(g(z))*g`(z).

The first factor, f`(g(z)), is to be understood this way.  Differentiate f(y) with respect to y; 
afterwards, replace y by g(z).

g'(z) is just the derivative of g with respect to z.
