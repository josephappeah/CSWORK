Hi Lisa,

Let me begin by saying that probably the single most educational thing
you could do for your students would be to go ahead and present the
problem, without knowing how to solve it, and work through it _together_.

I say this because if you stop a moment to think about what kids are
supposed to be learning in school, it's how to figure out what to do
when they don't know what to do.  Isn't that true?  If you believe
it's true, as I do, then it's interesting to consider how often kids
get a chance to observe their teachers doing that.  

I think most kids go through 12 years of formal education without
_ever_ seeing it, largely because teachers are careful not to present
problems that they don't already know the answers to - which is what
you're doing right now, correct? 

The solution to this problem is completely unimportant in the larger
scheme of things.  What's important are things like knowing how to
identify the assumptions you're making (and decide which ones can be
loosened up a little), how to keep track of what you've tried so you
don't go in circles, and so on.  

For what it's worth, I don't actually know the solution to this
problem.  What I _do_ know is that when the obvious approaches have
failed, a good thing to do is to reconsider how to interpret the words
in the problem.  For example, it might be a good idea to think about
what it means to have 'rows' of tulips.  

Here are two rows of 4 tulips:

        3               rows:  0123, 3456
      2   4
    1       5 
  0           6

I can add 3 more to get 4 rows of 4:

        3
    8       9           rows: 0123, 3456, 6728, 0749
      2   4
        7
    1       5 

  0           6

The rows aren't parallel or perpendicular to each other (which is
normally how we think of arranging things in 'rows'), and they're not
distinct.  And this opens up a lot more possibilities for arranging
the tulips.  

Does this help?  Write back if you'd like to talk more about this, or
anything else.
