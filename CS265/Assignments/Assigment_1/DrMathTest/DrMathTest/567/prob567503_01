First of all, if you know two angles of a triangle, you can find the 
third: C = 180 - 15 - 104 = 51 degrees.

If your side b is opposite angle B (the usual way we label these 
triangles, but using small letters for the sides), you can use the 
Law of Sines to find a missing side -- for instance, side a (opposite 
angle A):

  a/sin(A) = b/sin(B)

  a = b*sin(A)/sin(B)

Once you have side a as well as angle C, you can find the altitude 
from B to AC (vertical component of side a):

  v = a*sin(C)

and the component of side a parallel to side b:

  h = a*cos(C)
