It looks like you have an extra 6 in there.  One way to catch these
things is to leave everything un-multiplied until you've got things
arranged the way you want.  A good way to avoid the problems
altogether is to proceed one step at a time. 

For example, 

      y   8
      - = -
      8   6

      y     8
    6*- = 6*-             Multiply both sides by 6
      8     6

      y     
    6*- = 8               Cancel the 6's on the right.
      8     

      y     
  8*6*- = 8*8             Multiply both sides by 8.
      8     

            
    6*y = 8*8             Cancel the 8's on the right.

Now we can divide both sides by 6 to get

          8*8
      y = ---    
           6

But of course, we _could_ have just multiplied both sides by 8 to
begin with!

      y     8
    8*- = 8*-
      8     6

          8*8
      y = ---
           6

          64
        = --
           6

Do you see now where you went astray? 

These kinds of problems - called proportions - come up so often that
it's worth taking some time to learn to deal with them quickly and
easily.  Take a look at

  Flipping and Switching Fractions

and write back if it's not clear, or if you still have questions. 

Does this help?
