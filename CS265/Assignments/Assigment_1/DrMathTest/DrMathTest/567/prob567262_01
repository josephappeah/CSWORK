Hi Marriam,

Here's an example:  The square root of -2 is not defined, right? 
(Unless you get into complex numbers.)

So 

    1/2
  -2

is not defined; and neither would 

    3/2    5/2    7/2
  -2   , -2   , -2   

and so on.  

And of course, something like 

   3/0
  2

isn't defined, because division by zero isn't defined.

Does this help?
