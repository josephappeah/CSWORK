Hi Alex,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Someone asked me about a game similar
to Nim a little while ago, and that question is archived.  You can
learn a lot by reading it:

  Math Games Involving Forcing an Opponent into an Outcome
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/65232.html

In particular, two-thirds of that answer (the first seven paragraphs)
also apply to Nim and many other similar games.  It tells exactly how
a mathematician analyzes these types of games.

In your case, the "state" is the three numbers that are the sizes of
the three rows.  Notice that every possible move must take you closer
to the "final state" when all three rows are empty.  Then we analyze
just like I described until we notice a pattern.  It turns out that
the pattern for Nim is most easily described using binary.  So you
described the "losing states" as those whose digit-wise binary sums
are all even (in the manner you described).

So to explain why this works is just a matter of showing that if you
start in a "losing state" (you want this to be your opponent) then
every move you (he) can make will give you a "winning state" (one
where not all of the binary digit sums are even).  And then you prove
that if you start in a "winning state" (you want this to be you), then
there is always some move you can make to give your opponent a "losing
state."  Does that make sense?  Can you see why it works in Nim?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
