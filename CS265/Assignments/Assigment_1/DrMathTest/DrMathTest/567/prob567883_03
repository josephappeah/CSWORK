Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Yunus!

What you have discovered is well-known, and has even appeared as a
question and answer in our Archives.  Nevertheless, you have shown
quite a lot of ability in discovering and proving it yourself!
Congratulations!  Keep up the good work.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
