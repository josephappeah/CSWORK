Hi, Dan --

In an isosceles triangle, the altitude to the base divides the 
triangle into two congruent right triangles.  In your case each of 
those right triangles will have hypotenuse 8 feet and one leg 1.5 
feet.  Then you can simply use the basic trig functions to find your 
angles.  For each of the base angles x, we have

  cos(x) = 1.5/8

Use a calculator or trig tables or whatever to determine each of 
those angles; then the vertex angle is what is left to make the sum 
of the three angles equal to 180 degrees.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
