Hi, FrosT --

When you get to this point...

>    2x + 2
>    -------
>     x^2 + 2x

you can't do any cancelling.  You  tried to "cancel" the "2x" in the 
numerator and denominator; however, you can't do this.  (And even if 
you could... what is left when you cancel is "1", not "0"....)

You can only cancel common FACTORS between the numerator and 
denominator of a fraction.  In your expression, the "2x" and "2" in 
the numerator are added together; neither one is a factor.  Likewise 
in the denominator -- you don't have any factors to try to cancel.

You can rewrite both the numerator and denominator in factored form -
- but it turns out it doesn't help in this case, because none of the 
terms are common:

   2x+2    2(x+1)
  ------ = ------
  x^2+2x   x(x+2)

If you had an "x+2" in both numerator and denominator at this point, 
you could cancel them.  But there are no common factors, so this is 
as far as the expression can be simplified.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
