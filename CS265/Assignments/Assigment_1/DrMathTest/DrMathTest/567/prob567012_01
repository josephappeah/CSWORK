Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

[] are brackets. They act just like parentheses. People use them to
differentiate them from parentheses in long expressions. If you like,
you can just substitute parentheses:

    2[18-(5+3Squared)divided by 7]

  = 2(18-(5+3Squared)divided by 7)

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
