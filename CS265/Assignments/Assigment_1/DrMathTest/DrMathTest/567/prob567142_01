Hi Nathan,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  If you are speaking to a
mathematician, then you can say "the smallest nonnegative residue of 7
mod 3," or sometimes just "7 mod 3."  If you are speaking to a
computer programmer, then you can almost certainly just say "7 mod 3."
 If you are speaking to someone else, then you should probably say
"the reminder when you divide 7 by 3."

Does that answer your question?  If you have any questions about this
or need more help, please write back, and I will try to offer further
suggestions.
