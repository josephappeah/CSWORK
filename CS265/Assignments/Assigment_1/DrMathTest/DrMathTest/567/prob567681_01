Hi Ken,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The "best" formula is the one that
uses the information you have, and no more, and gives you the
information you want, so it depends very much on the circumstances.

That said, I am not an endocrinologist, and we use different terms in
math, so I'm not sure what those three measurements are.  I assume
that the formulas you refer to on our site are from the "ellipsoid"
link on

  Formulas: Geometric
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/

which takes you to

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.ellipsoid.html

where the formula is

  V = (4/3)*pi*a*b*c

and a, b, and c are the radii (half the diameters) in the three
dimensions.

I think "transverse measurement" probably means the length across the
longest part of the ellipsoid (that's the 3-D version of the 2-D
ellipse), which should correspond to

  2*a.

Then I look up "saggital" at

  http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=sagittal%20plane

and it sounds like you are describing the area of a cross-section of
the ellipsoid, which would also be an ellipse, and that area would be

  pi*b*c,

but I have no idea what "AP" could possibly mean.  Can you help me out
there?  And can you verify that I understood the other two correctly?
