Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

If it confuses you, try it in a number sentence:

   1  <  2

We read this as "1 is less than 2". So, using it in a sentence, we
know that < is "less than" and > is "greater than".

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
