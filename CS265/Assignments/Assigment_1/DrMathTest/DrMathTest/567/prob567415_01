Hi Kristen,

Note that if the decimal expansion is going to terminate, it's got to
be the case that

  numerator     numerator * something
  ----------- = ---------------------
  denominator     some power of 10


                numerator * something
              = ---------------------
                       (2*5)^n

Does this help?
