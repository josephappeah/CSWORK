Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Drew!

This one needs a pretty obscure trick.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (sec[x]+tan[x]).  Then 
substitute u = sec(x) + tan(x), du = sec(x)*tan(x) + sec^2(x) dx.
Then you have to integrate 1/u du, which is pretty easy.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
