Hi Andrea,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Do you know what etymology is?  That's
what you want, which is not a math question but an English one. 
Search the internet (e.g. Google) for the word

  etymology

or perhaps

  etymological dictionary

and you should find resources that tell you where words come from. 
And remember that not all words come from Latin.  For example, at

  http://www.etymonline.com/

they told me this about "inch":

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
