Hi Territa,

The abbreviation LCM stands for 'least common multiple'.  To
understand what that is, you need to understand all three words.  

Let's look at the numbers 4 and 6.  I can generate the multiples of 4
by counting by 4's:

  4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...

I can generate the multiples of 6 by counting by 6's:

  6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...

Now, if I compare those two lists, I see that some multiples appear in
both lists:

  4,  8, 12, 16,     20, 24, 28,    32, 36, ...
          |               |              |
    6,   12,     18,     24,    30,     36, ...

Because 4 and 6 _share_ these multiples, or have them 'in common', we
say that the 'common multiples' of 4 and 6 are

  12, 24, 36, ...

Of all the common multiples in the list, only one can be the smallest,
or 'least'.  In this case, that's 12.  So we say that the 'least
common multiple' of 4 and 6 is 12.

Does this make sense?  Can you use the same reasoning to find the
least common multiple of 5 and 15?  Try it and let me know what you
come up with.
