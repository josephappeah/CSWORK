Hi Ashkan,

Do you mean is it worth publishing?  Well, if it was easy (I haven't
tried it), then it probably wouldn't be significant enough to publish
in a collegiate math journal, but as long as the solution is
interesting it might be worth publishing in some kind of high school
or similar math journal.
