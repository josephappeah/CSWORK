Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Dhinesh!

The flaw is that to draw that conclusion, you have to divide by
zero, and that is not allowed.

If

   a^x = a^y,

then, taking logarithms of both sides, you get

   log(a^x) = log(a^y),
   x*log(a) = y*log(a).

Now you want to divide both sides by log(a).  This is fine unless
either log(a) is undefined (that is, a isn't positive) or log(a) is
zero (that is, a = 1).

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
