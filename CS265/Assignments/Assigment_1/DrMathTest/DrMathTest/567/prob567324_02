It looks impossible to me! Maybe I'm not understanding the problem. 
Did you mean that there are two columns and TWO rows in the square? 
Then you have to write four numbers using the 8 digits. Since the 
sums are all 12, no number can have more than 2 digits, so each 
number must have exactly 2 digits. But using the digits once each, 
you can't make ANY 2-digit number that is less than 12, so it is 
impossible to get even one row or column to add up to 12.

What am I misunderstanding? Can you try explaining the puzzle again?
