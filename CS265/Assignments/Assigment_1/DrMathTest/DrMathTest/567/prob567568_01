The formula you are using can be simplified. If you found the formula 
here (one of several pages in our Archives on this topic, and 
probably the oldest):

  Using Longitude and Latitude to Determine Distance
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51711.html

then take a look farther down the page where a simpler version is 
given:

d = R*arccos(sin(lat1)*sin(lat2)+cos(lat1)*cos(lat2)*cos(lon1-lon2))

This shouldn't affect your results, however. (You can also improve 
the efficiency of your code by calculating each trig function only 
once, setting a variable to each value you need to use more than 
once.)

I see also that you are using a formula to get the arccosine in terms 
of arctan, presumably because your language does not have an arccos 
function. That part looks fine.

I am not sure of the meaning of your latitudes and longitudes; my 
best guess is that they are of the form [D]DDMM.MMM, that is, 3 
digits (2 for latitudes) for the degrees and the rest for decimal 
minutes. If I assume this format and plug the numbers into my 
spreadsheet, I get a distance of 2.924534468 miles, so my guess 
appears to be correct.

You will need to convert the latitudes and longitudes to decimal 
degrees before converting degrees to radians. Can you do this 
conversion? It will probably involve mod and integer-division 
functions to separate degrees from minutes. Then divide the minutes 
by 60 and add the degrees.
