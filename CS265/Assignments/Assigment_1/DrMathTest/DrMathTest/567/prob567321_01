Hi Amber,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Do you know how to find the slope of
the line through two given points, say (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)?

   m = ?  (some formula involving x1,x2,y1, and y2).

If so, can you see any circumstance under which this slope will be
undefined?

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
