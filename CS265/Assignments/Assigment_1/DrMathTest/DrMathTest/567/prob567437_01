Hi Saprina,

>can a cube be classified as a rectangular prism? Why or why not.

Here's a related question:  Can a square be classified as a rectangle?  

A way to think about questions like this, i.e., 

  Is an X also a Y?           

is to make up some kind of test that can tell you for sure whether
something is in the second class (Y), and then see if something from
the first class (X) passes that test. 

For example, suppose we want to ask:

  Is a dog also a mammal?

We can make up a test like 

  A mammal is warm-blooded, has hair or fur, and bears live young.

Then we can ask about a dog:

  Is it warm-blooded?  Yes.
  Does it have hair or fur?  Yes.
  Does it bear live young?  Yes.

It passes the test, so a dog is also a mammal. 

With all that in mind, do you think that a square is also a rectangle?
 Do you think that a cube is also a rectangular prism?
