I'm not really sure what they're looking for here. The idea of a
"benchmark" number is used in some texts, but is not a precisely
defined concept; and it's often hard to say what is a resonable
estimate. In these examples, I'd say that the 10 and 20 are already
benchmark numbers, since it's very easy to multiply by them; my
"estimates" would be the exact numbers 240 and 160. And neither
estimate given is particularly close; I'd never make those estimates
myself by any method I can imagine.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
