Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Jennifer!

Differentiation is the name given to the process of finding a
derivative.  The verb is "to differentiate".

Let x be the independent variable, and y a dependent variable.  The
derivative y with respect to x (denoted dy/dx) is the instantaneous
rate of change y with respect to x, that is, the amount of change
in y per unit change in x.  In other words, if x changes by a small
amount, what change in y do you see?  To find derivatives, you need
to understand limits.  If you do, then this is how the derivative is
defined.

Let y = f(x).  Then

   dy/dx = lim [f(x+h)-f(x)]/h.
           h->0

You see that h is a change in x, from x to x+h.  The values of y
which correspond are f(x) and f(x+h).  The change in x is (x+h) - x,
or h, and the change in y is f(x+h) - f(x).  The ratio of the change
in y to the change in x is the fraction inside the limit.  That's
the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval
[x,x+h].  Taking the limit as h approaches zero gives the
instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x at the point
(x,f(x)).  That's the derivative dy/dx at that same point.

Sometimes the limit does not exist, or is infinite.  In those cases,
the derivative is undefined for that value of x.

If you draw the graph of the function y = f(x), you can see that the
two points (x,f(x)) and (x+h,f(x+h)) are on the curve, and the ratio
[f(x+h)-f(x)]/h is the slope of the line joining these points.  That
line is a secant of the curve.  As h approaches zero, the secant
approaches the tangent to the curve at (x,f(x).  The limit of the
slope thus approaches the slope of the tangent line at that point
(unless, of course, the curve has no tangent, or more than one
tangent, there).  Thus the value of the derivative dy/dx at that
point is the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) there.

The study of limits, derivatives, and differentiation is usually
part of a beginning course in calculus.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
