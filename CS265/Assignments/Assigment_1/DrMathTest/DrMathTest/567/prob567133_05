Hi Mike,

Yes, I realized that distinction after a while.  Over Q, the
rationals, a field extension may contain one root without containing
any others, or may contain some roots without containing all.  One of
the properties of finite fields is that a polynomial with one root in
a finite field will have all of its roots in the finite field.  You
can probably find this proven in your text book.  One way to see this
is to note that all elements of the finite field GF(q) are roots of
the polynomial

  x^q - x.

So if "a" is in the field, then the minimal polynomial for a (the
unique monic irreducible polynomial which has a as a root) must be a
factor of the polynomial

  x^q - x.

But then, not only are all elements of the field roots of that
polynomial, so too are all roots of that polynomial elements of the
field!  So all of the roots of the irreducible polynomial for a (that
is, the Galois conjugates of a) are in the field.
