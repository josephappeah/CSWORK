Hi Jill,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You have a fundamental problem here,
in that a tablespoon measures volume, while a gram measures mass.  For
example, a tablespoon of air will mass much fewer grams than a
tablespoon of sugar, which will mass much fewer grams than a
tablespoon of water.  But you can convert grams to metrics at

  Convertit.com Measurement Converter
  http://www.convertit.com/
  http://www.convertit.com/Go/ConvertIt/Measurement/Converter.ASP

by entering "1 tablespoon" in the box on the left, and "cubic
centimeters" (or "cc") in the box on the right.  The metric system was
designed so that 1 cc of water masses exactly 1 gram.  So one
tablespoon of water masses approximately

  14.786 grams.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
