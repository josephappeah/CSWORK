First work out the time when the two flames meet.  Their speed of 
approach is 1.5 + 2.1 = 3.6 ins/hr

The Total distance = 12 inches so

                12
        Time = ---- =  10/3 hours  = 3 + 1/3 hours
>               3.6

So the top flame will have travelled a distance  1.5 x 10/3

                                              =  5 inches

  The flames meet at a point 5 inches from the top.
