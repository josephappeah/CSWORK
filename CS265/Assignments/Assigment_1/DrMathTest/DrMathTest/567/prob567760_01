Hi Rey,

Take a look at

  Fractions, decimals, percentages
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.fractions.html

and write back if it's not clear, or if you still have questions. In
particular, if you can show me a problem that you're having trouble
with, and the steps you would take to try to solve it on your own,
that would help me figure out the best way to help you understand this.

Does this help?
