Hi Firat,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I would write this as:

  a/b  ->  [m(a/b) + n]/[(a/b) + 1].

That is,

  x    ->  (mx + n)/(x + 1).

Now the trick is that if you keep doing this, and you expect it to end
up at a certain number, then you should also expect that applying the
transform to that number would not change it, right?  So that means
that you should solve for x in

  (mx + n)/(x + 1) = x.

Note, in particular, what this means when m=1, n=2 (in your first
example).

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
