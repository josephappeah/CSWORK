Hi Tim,

Note that what you've done here is multiply rate by distance, not rate
by time.  Since

  rate * time = distance

if you're given rate and distance, you need to divide:

         time = distance/rate

Try that, and you'll get two quantities, with units of hours. 
Subtract to get the difference, and note that there are 3600 seconds
in an hour...

Can you take it from here?
