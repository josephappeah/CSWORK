Hi Rose,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The series is

                t^2   t^3         t^n
  e^t = 1 + t + --- + --- + ... + --- + ...
                 2!    3!          n!

which has an infinite number of terms.  "Use 7 terms of the series"
means to use the terms with n = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.  It has nothing to
do with the value of t: now you have an approximate equality


                t^2   t^3         t^6
  e^t ~ 1 + t + --- + --- + ... + --- 
                 2!    3!          6!   .

Substitute the t values of interest (e.g. t = 4) into this sum.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
