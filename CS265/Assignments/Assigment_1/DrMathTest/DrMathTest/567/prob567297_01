Hi Taylar,

I'm not quite sure what you're asking.  First, have you memorized all
the single-digit products, from 1x1 through 10x10?  That's really the
starting point for everything else, and as you've noted, trying to
figure those out is too slow.  You need to commit them to memory, and
you need to remember them perfectly.  

If you're having trouble doing that, take a look at

Does this help?
