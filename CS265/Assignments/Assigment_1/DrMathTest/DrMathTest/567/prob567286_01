I'd hope you'd know by now that 1 divided by 2 is one-half, and that 
the decimal equal to 1/2 is 0.5. But it's less likely that you'd 
remember something like the decimal equal to 9/16. Let's do that. 
It's just a matter of dividing with a decimal point.

       0.5 6 2 5
     -----------
  16 ) 9.0 0 0 0
       8 0
       ---
       1 0 0
         9 6
       -----
           4 0
           3 2
           ---
             8 0
             8 0
             ---

At the start I tried to divide 9 by 16 but of course I couldn't; 9 is 
less than 16. Therefore, as usual in division, I had to bring down 
the next digit from the dividend -- but there wasn't one (at first). 
That's when I added the decimal point and a zero after it; I know 
that 9 is the same as 9.0, and this gives me a digit to bring down.

Now I divide 90 by 16, and the largest whole number of 16's that will 
go into 90 is 5, since 5 * 16 = 80. I write down the 80 and subtract 
it from 90, getting a remainder of 10.

I bring down the next digit from the dividend -- which again isn't 
there until I add another zero to the dividend: 9.00 is still the 
same number as 9. I keep going like this until I get no remainder; my 
answer is 9/16 = 0.5625.

In most cases you will never get a zero remainder. Instead we get 
something called repeating decimals. For most purposes all you really 
have to do is stop dividing when you have enough decimal places; you 
don't really need the exact answer, just something close. But you can 
search the Dr. Math Archives for information on repeating decimals if 
you're interested.
