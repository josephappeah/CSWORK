Hi Martin,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The integrand is a rational function,
but not a proper rational function, since the degree of the numerator
is equal to the degree of the denominator.  In such a situation, you
should always first make the rational function proper by carrying out
the long division to obtain a polynomial plus a proper rational 
function.  At worst, you will need to use Partial Fractions to 
integrate the proper rational function, but in this case, that isn't
necessary.  An algebraic trick also lets you avoid the explicit long
division: write

   2x - 1   2x + 1 - 1 - 1
   ------ = --------------   .
   2x + 1       2x + 1

                   2
          = 1 - ------
                2x + 1   .

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
