Hi Angela,

First, take a look at these:

  Variables, Explained
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/62905.html

  Variables: Connecting Letters and Numbers
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57312.html

That should help you get a handle on what the letters are for, and how
to think about them.  Then take a look at 

  Distributive Property, Illustrated
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52842.html

to see what the distributive property has to do with all this. 

Does this help?
