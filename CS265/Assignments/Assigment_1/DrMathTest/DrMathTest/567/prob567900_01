Hi Alex,

I think you are trying to determine that

   lim     S
 n -> inf   n

exists (and is finite).  You have already determined that the sequence
is bounded.  It is not hard to show that it is increasing:

                1      1     1
  S    = S  + ---- + ---- - ---
   n+1    n   2n+2   2n+1   n+1

                   1
  S    = S  + ------------
   n+1    n   2(n+1)(2n+1)

and every bounded, increasing sequence converges to some value.

Are you trying to determine what that value is?  Look at the
difference between the integral you used and the series.  You might
also find useful the following answer:

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
