Hi,

"HCF" stands for Highest Common Factor, which is also known as 'greatest common 
divisor' or GCD.  The latter terminology, GCD, is used more often in the mathematical 
literature and therefore we will use this notation instead.

"LCM" stands for Least Common Multiple.

Some examples may make these ideas more clear.  The GCD of two numbers, say x and y, 
is the largest divisor of both.  So for instance,

     GCD(15,27) = 3,

because the largest number which divides both 15 and 27 is 3.  One way we can determine 
the GCD is to find the prime factorization of each number, and then choose the largest 
prime powers occurring in both.  So for example,

     15 = (3)(5) = (3^1)(5^1),
     27 = (3*3*3) = (3^3).

The largest power of 3 that is common to both numbers is 3^1 = 3, and the largest power 
of 5 that is common to both numbers is 5^0 = 1, because 5 is not a prime factor of 27.

As another example, GCD(600,420) = 60, because

     600 = (2*2*2)(3)(5*5) = (2^3)(3^1)(5^2),
     420 = (2*2)(3)(5)(7) = (2^2)(3^1)(5^1)(7^1),

and so the largest prime powers occurring in both are 2^2, 3^1, and 5^1, the product of 
which is 60.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest multiple of both, so for example

     LCM(10,25) = 50,

because 50 is the smallest number that is a multiple of 10 as well as 25.  One way to 
compute the LCM is to take the largest prime powers occurring in either prime 
factorization, so

     10 = (2)(5) = (2^1)(5^1)
     25 = (5*5) = (5^2);

the largest power of 2 is 2^1, and the largest power of 5 is 5^2, so the LCM is 2*25 = 50.

Interestingly, the GCD can be computed without finding the prime factorization of a 
number, by the Euclidean Algorithm.  This method is fast and is the traditional way to 
compute the GCD.  Let's find

     GCD(195,525).

To do this, we compute the quotient and remainder of 525/195:

     525 = 2(195) + 135.

We repeat the process with the divisor and remainder of the previous step, so we want to 
find the quotient and remainder of 195/135:

     195 = 1(135) + 60.

The process continues until the remainder is zero:

     135 = 2(60) + 15,
     60 = 4(15) + 0.

The GCD is the last nonzero remainder, which is 15, so GCD(195,525) = 15.  Let's do 
another:

     GCD(421,597):

     597 = 1(421) + 176
     421 = 2(176) + 69
     176 = 2(69) + 38
     69 = 1(38) + 31
     38 = 1(31) + 7
     31 = 4(7) + 3
     7 = 2(3) + 1
     3 = 3(1) + 0,

so GCD(421,597) = 1.  When the GCD of two numbers is equal to 1, we say that they are 
relatively prime.  That is, they have no nontrivial common divisor.

You might think that this algorithm is as easy as factoring the numbers, but it really is.  To 
to see why, try to compute

     GCD(59125700152712,39399572875124)

by factoring the numbers, and then by using the Euclidean Algorithm.

Here's a question for you:  Is there a similar algorithm to find the LCM of two numbers?
