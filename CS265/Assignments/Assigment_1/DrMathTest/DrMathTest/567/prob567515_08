Hello Pedro,

It may be that I was careless.  I'll copy my earlier message below and check it, line-by-line.



We want to show that if

F(y) = int(x=a,x=b,f(x,y)*dx)

then

F'(y) = int(x=a,x=b,D_2 f(x,y)*dx) for each y in (c,d).

[Above, in the statement of the theorem, y is a general variable within (c,d).
Below, we 
take a specific y in (c,d) and denote this y by y_0; the notation was chosen to
emphasize to 
me that y_0 is fixed.  Then,  I took a variable y as the point to approach y_0
in the limit 
process leading to the derivative F'(y_0).]

Let y_0 be in (c,d).  We can calculate

[F(y) - F(y_0)]/(y-y_0) = int(x=a,x=b,D_2 f(x,Y)*dx) ,

where Y is between y and y_0.  [With y_0 fixed, Y depends upon both x and y.]
If the limit of the left side exists, it should be int(x=a,x=b,D_2 f(x,y)*dx). 

!! I should have written "it should be int(x=a,x=b,D_2 f(x,y_0)*dx). "  I'll make necessary 
changes below.

We subtract this quantity (which exists, from hypothesis) from 
both sides:

[F(y) - F(y_0)]/(y-y_0) - int(x=a,x=b,D_2 f(x,y_0)*dx)

          =  int(x=a,x=b, [ D_2 f(x,Y) - D_2 f(x,y_0) ]*dx)

Now take absolute values and use the uniform continuity of D_2 f.  The right
side is less than eps*(b-a) .

I'm sorry to have made the error; thank you for finding it.
