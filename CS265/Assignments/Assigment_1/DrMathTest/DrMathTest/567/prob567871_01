Hi Mayank,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  That's a good question.  In the case 
of the circle, that definition of eccentricity is not quite accurate.  
For a circle, the directrix has to be infinitely far away.  You can 
intuitively think of that ratio as being a constant (the radius) 
divided by infinity, but perhaps that's not very convincing.

So perhaps the best way to explain why the eccentricity of a circle is 
0 is in terms of a limit.  If you use a small eccentricity, you get an 
ellipse.  If the eccentricity is REALLY small, then the ellipse is 
almost a circle.  So if you think of taking a limit as the 
eccentricity approaches zero, the ellipse gets closer and closer to a 
circle, so that the limiting shape of the figure is a circle.

Does this help?  If you have any questions about this or need more 
help, please write back, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
