Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Infinity is NOT a number. So 1/infinity doesn't make sense as a
number. We can define infinitessimals, but they would be defined in a
slightly different number system with extended rules of arithmetic.
They are not defined in our standard real number system.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
