You haven't written the solution of the system

(the vector on the right should be a 2-dimensional vector - my error.)
If you multiply the matrix and vector on the left, you get the column
vector

   [ y ]   [ 0 ]
   [ z ] = [ 0 ] ,

so y = z = 0, and there is no restriction on x.  The solution of 
Rv=0, when R is the above matrix, consists of vectors of the form

     [ x ]
 v = [ 0 ]
     [ 0 ]   .  

If you look at your list of possible forms for S, 

>1 0 b   1 a b   0 1 a   0 0 1   0 1 0   1 a 0
>0 1 a   0 0 0   0 0 0   0 0 0   0 0 1   0 0 1

the first, second, or sixth, applied to the solution v of Rv = 0,
clearly give a non-zero result (if x is not 0).  The other three
forms have solutions which are not of the form of v above.

There are a lot of possibilities, but you can narrow them by using
some general facts about matrices.  If Rv = 0 and Sv = 0 have exactly
the same solutions, then they must have the same rank, so you just 
need to consider 6 cases where R and S are rank 2, and 6 where both
are of rank 1.

Does that help?
