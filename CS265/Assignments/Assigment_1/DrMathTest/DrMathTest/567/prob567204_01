That's exactly correct. If you disregard imaginary numbers, there is 
no number whose square is -4, therefore there is no number that is 
the square root of -4. In order to give the expression any meaning, 
you *must* allow imaginary numbers.

In that case, there are two square roots of -4: 2i and -2i. Each, 
when squared, gives -4:

  2i * 2i = (2*2)*(i*i)
          = 4*-1
          = -4

  -2i * -2i = (-2*-2)(i*i)
            = 4*-1
            = -4

It's possible that the reviewer wasn't thinking about imaginary 
numbers and just wanted to give the movie no rating at all. If he/she 
had the imaginary number concept in mind, I don't know what 
an "imaginary" rating would mean to the reviewer -- maybe either way 
he is opining that the movie strains belief too much.

Does this help, or are you asking for something more?
