Hi Pedro,

I answered your question before.  When you write

  f(x) = ...

you are implicitly stating that the thing on the right side of the
equation is a function of x, since you are stating that f is a
function of x.  That means that everything that appears on the right
side is a function of x.  Sometimes, there might be a constant (or
several), as in

  f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c,

where the particular values of those constants change what function f
you are talking about, but those constants should be thought of as
independent of x.  That, in fact, is what MAKES them constant.

You see,

  f(x) = 3

is a function of x.  But it is a constant function.  So a constant is
a special TYPE of function of x.  So the first choice choice (y is a
constant) is really a special case of the second choice (y is a
function of x), and the second choice is what is stated by writing

  f(x) = ...

In other words, y might be affected by other things, but if it's not
affected by x, then it's a constant with respect to x and therefore f.

Does that make things any more clear?  If it doesn't, then you should
give me the context in which this statement appears, and I will try to
make sense of it and explain more clearly what the author meant.
