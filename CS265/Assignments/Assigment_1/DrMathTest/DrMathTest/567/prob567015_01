Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

>1) lim of sqrt(7arctan n + 3)
>1) can i say limit = sqrt(7pi/2 + 3)

Assuming that the limit in the first line is the limit as n->+oo,
yes.  Sqrt(x) is a continuous function for x > 0, and continuous from
the right at x=0.  So, if 

   lim a(n) = A , then  lim sqrt(a(n)) = sqrt(A) .
  n->oo                n->oo      

>2)im having trouble understanding what this question requires of me? 

Your terminology is confusing.  One usually speaks of "row echelon
form" and "reduced row echelon form".  By putting "reduced" between
"row" and "echelon", it's not clear what the problem wants, since
the process of obtaining either form is called "row reduction".  See

   http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/RowEchelonForm.html
   http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/ReducedRowEchelonForm.html
   http://www.mathwords.com/r/row-echelon_form.htm
   http://www.mathwords.com/r/reduced_row_echelon_form.htm

for explanations of the two forms.

Your solution to (3) isn't correct.  You need to examine all the
possible reduced row echelon forms for a 2x3 matrix, and show that 
for each possible form for R, if S is not R, the two equations Rx=0
and Sx=0 will have different solutions.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
