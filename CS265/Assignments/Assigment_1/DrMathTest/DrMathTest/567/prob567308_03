Thanks for writing back to Ask Dr. Math, Sai!

I think I'd approach this using vectors.

The radius vectors from the center of the circle to the three points
are easy to find, by taking the difference of the coordinates of the
points minus the coordinates of the center.  The dot product of any
two divided by R^2 will give you the cosine of the angle between
them.  Pick the pair of vectors v(0) and v(50) with the smallest
cosine value, and you'll have the two endpoints of the arc.  Taking
the arccosine will give you the angle theta between those two
vectors.  Theta should be taken between 0 and 180 degrees (or 0 and
Pi radians).

Now to divide the arc into 50 parts, you seek 49 vectors v(k),
k = 1, 2, ..., 49, such that the following equations hold:

   v(k).(A,B,C) = 0,
   v(k).v(0) = R^2*cos(k*theta/50),
   |v(k)| = R.

The first two are linear equations in the components of v(k), and
the last is quadratic.  There should be two solutions, of which one
is correct, the other is extraneous.  The extraneous one will not
satisfy the equation

   v(k).v(50) = R^2*cos([1-k/50]*theta),

and the correct one will.  Then the 49 division points on the arc
are found by adding the components of v(k) to the coordinates of
the center of the circle.

To change radius to R', multiply the vectors v(k) by the scalar
R'/R, for k = 0, 1, ..., 50, and add each of those to the
coordinates of the center.  Those will be the 51 points on the arc
with radius R', the same center, and lying in the same plane.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
