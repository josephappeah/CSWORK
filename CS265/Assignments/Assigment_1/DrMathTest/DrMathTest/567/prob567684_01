Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Anjie!

You've got it a little mixed up.

For a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0, you need to find two numbers r and s which
when multiplied give you a*c, and when added give you b.  Then the
factorization is given by (a*x+r)*(a*x+s)/a, simplified.

For 2*x^2 + 5*x - 3 = 0, you need to find two numbers which when
multiplied give you (2)*(-3) = -6, and when added give you 5.  In
this case, 6 and -1 will work.  That means that the factorization
is given by (2*x+6)*(2*x-1)/2 = (x+3)*(2*x-1).

Use FOIL to check your answers.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
