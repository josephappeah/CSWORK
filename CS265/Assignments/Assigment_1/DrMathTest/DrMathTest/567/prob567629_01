Do you know any formulas involving the circumference and diameter of 
a circle, or the circumference and radius of a circle? That's a good 
place to start.

For example, most of us learn the formula

  Circumference = 2 * pi * Radius

If you knew the radius of a circle, this formula would let you 
calculate the circumference of the circle. You'd multiply the radius 
by 2 times pi (pi is about 3.14).

You don't know the radius; you know the circumference. You need to 
turn the formula "inside-out". This is called solving the equation 
for the radius. Do you know what you can do to the equation above to 
get Radius alone on the right side?

I would like to hear from you if these clues alone are not enough for 
you to figure out the answer. I don't know what you have learned, and 
I don't want to just give you an answer; I want to help you figure it 
out for yourself. So tell me what you know about circles, and what 
you know about equations.
