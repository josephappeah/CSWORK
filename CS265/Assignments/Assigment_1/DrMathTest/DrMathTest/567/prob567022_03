Hi Koh,

For the integration by parts problem, it is much better to leave the
trigonometric function as sin(2x), and differentiate the polynomial
term.  You will still have to do three integrations by parts, a tedious
computation.

I'm not familiar with the "tabular form" version, but I think it must
be equivalent to the regular form.
