Hi, Stephanie --

This is a classic problem to show that your intuition can fail 
you....

Suppose you have a circle of a given radius r meters; its 
circumference is 2pi times r meters.  If you increase the radius by 
x meters, the circumference is now 2pi times (r+x):

  2pi(r+x) = 2pi(r) + 2pi(x)

When the radius is increased by x meters, the circumference 
increases by 2pi(x) meters.

Conversely, if you increase the circumference of a circle by x 
meters, then the radius increases by x/(2pi) meters.

So the earth has a certain circumference, and you increase the 
circumference by 5 meters.  The radius increases by 5/2pi meters, 
which is somewhere between 2.5 and 3 feet.  Certainly that is enough 
for most people to crawl through....

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
