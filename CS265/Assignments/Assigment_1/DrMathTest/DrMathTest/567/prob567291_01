Hi Christian,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  First of all, the n=3 pattern and the
n=6 pattern are the same ones.

That said, if you start with any positive integer and use your
formula, there are only two possibilities for what happens:  Either
the sequence will eventually repeat a number, which means it will end
up in a loop.  Or the sequence will never repeat which means that it
will keep producing bigger and bigger numbers (not necessarily one
right after the other, but eventually you will have used all of the
numbers under a million that you are going to, and then you have to
give a bigger number).  Since for large numbers dividing by two gets a
lot smaller than adding 9 gets bigger, it should be considered
extremely unlikely for the second case ever to happen.  Proving that
it never happens might be extremely difficult, however.

On the other hand, suppose that you have a loop like those above.  It
is easy to prove that it will be one of the three you found.  This is
how:  Let n be the smallest number that appears in your loop.  Now, n
must be odd, since otherwise n/2 would be a smaller number in the same
loop.  So that means that the number following n is n+9, which must be
even, and that means that the number after that is (n+9)/2.  This last
number can't be smaller than n, since n is the smallest number in the
loop, so that means that

  n <= (n+9)/2
  2n <= n+9
  n <= 9.

Now you just have to check the numbers from 1 to 9, which you already
did, since one of those numbers will appear in every loop.  And you
find that there are only three loops.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
