The problem as stated was:

Mary is 24 years old. Mary is twice as old as Ana was when Mary was 
as old as Ana is now. How old is Ana?

The only past tenses are the two uses of "was", referring to Ana's 
age then and Mary's age then. You're right, "was" is simple past, not 
past perfect (that would be "had been"). However, the controlling 
verb for the issue under debate is the "is" in "Mary is twice as 
old ..." This is present tense, and there is no reason to associate 
this present tense with a time in the past.

Are you both speakers of English as a first language? In some other 
language perhaps the tenses would be used differently, but to those 
who know English well, the question would not be interpreted the way 
this person interprets it.

The question is more about English grammar than about math, but you 
may mention what I have said -- not as an appeal to authority but as 
a presentation of reasons for our position.
