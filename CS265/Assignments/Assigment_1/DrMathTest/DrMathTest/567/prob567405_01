Hi Don,

Well, series of _digits_.  It's important to use clear terminology
when talking about this stuff, or you can get completely confused.

Any finite sequence of digits?  Yes.  If you pick any finite sequence
digits, you should be able to find it _somewhere_ in the expansion of
a randomly chosen irrational number.  

Of course, that depends on the number.  For some artificially
constructed numbers, it will _not_ be true.  For example, here is an
irrational number:   

  0.10110111011110111110

Do you see why it will never repeat or terminate?  Do you also see why
the sequence '123' will never, ever appear? 

>and since they are infinite, is it also possible

Here's what I meant about terminology.  The numbers themselves aren't
infinite - the square root of 2 is irrational, but it's _very_ finite.
 What's infinite is the number of digits in the decimal expansion of
the number.  Do you see the difference?

Since it's the length of the decimal expansion that's infinite, you
can't really find another irrational number in there, because you've
really just got digit sequences, which would normally be interpreted
as integers, which are not irrational.  

But here's the thing.  We know that pi is irrational.  So let's write
some of the sequence of digits in pi:

  3.14159...

This sequence continues without terminating or repeating.  So suppose
we move the decimal place over by one, to get

  31.4159...

This is certainly another irrational number, and in some sense it's
'contained' in pi.  So if you're not too careful about how you phrase
things, the answer to your question could be 'yes'. 

>and if the

It doesn't really make sense to say that any number is a 'subset' of
another number.  Subsets of sets are themselves sets.  Numbers aren't
sets.  

Does this help?
