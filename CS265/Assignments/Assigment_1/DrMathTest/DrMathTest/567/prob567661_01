Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Colin!

Suppose the polynomial equation that n satisfies is p(x) = 0.  Then
n+1 satisfies p(x-1) = 0.  You have to show that this is also a
polynomial equation in x with integer coefficients.  Probably you
should think about the Binomial Theorem applied to each term of
p(x-1).

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
