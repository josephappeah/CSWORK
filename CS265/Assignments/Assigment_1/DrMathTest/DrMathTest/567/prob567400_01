Hi, Jordan --

You apparently are thinking that you need to have more than one 
column.  Not so; you can put all the objects in one column.

So to make a rectangular array for the number 5, you can have one 
column with 5 objects in it.  And of course you could also have 5 
columns, each with 1 object in it.

I'm guessing the reason you are being asked to do this is so that 
you can discover which numbers can only be represented by 
rectangular arrays with only one column or only one row....
