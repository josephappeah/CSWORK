Hi Meagan,

that's an excellent start.  Note that it's simpler to write it as

  28mn - 12dc

Now, let's ask if these two terms have anything in common.  What
occurs to me is that both 28 and 12 are even numbers, so they're both
divisible by 2.  This means that

  28mn - 12dc = 2*14mn - 2*6dc

              = 2(14mn - 6dc)

Now, do 14 and 6 have any common divisors?  If so, you can factor them
out as well, and keep going until there are no common divisors of the
two terms. 

Give it a try, and let me know what you come up with, okay?
