Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

A moving average is an average that is computed for every N data
points. For example, let's say that I had temperature data for the
last 300 days. In order to avoid worrying about unusual days (say 1
day was 10 degrees warmer/colder than the 15 days around it), I
consider 5 day averages. This means we record the average temperature
of the previous 5 days. This has the effect of "smoothing" the curve.

Consider stocks. Whenever you see a stock's performance in the past
represented graphically, it appears very jagged if you look at it on
an hourly basis. However, if you take a moving average for every 2 day
period, it looks much smoother. If the moving average is for 1 week
periods, the plot looks even smoother.

So, long-term trends in the data can be observed while "filtering" the
short-term noise.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
