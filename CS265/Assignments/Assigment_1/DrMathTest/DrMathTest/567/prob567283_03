Hi Firat,

That's not what I got.  Why don't you show me how you got that, and
I'll try to figure out what you did wrong.

As for a proof, perhaps you would do well to start here:

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
