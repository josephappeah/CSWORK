Hi Kevin,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The equation 

   sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) = c

defines a curve in the first quadrant (both x and y must
be positive since they are under the radical).  Suppose
(x0,y0) is a point on this curve.  Then

  sqrt(x0) + sqrt(y0) = c  .

The problem first asks you to use implicit differentiation 
to find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the
point (x0,y0) (which is the derivative y' or dy/dx, evaluated
at the point).  When you use implicit differentiation, the
formula for dy/dx will have both x and y in the formula.

Then, knowing the value of the slope m = dy/dx (evaluated at
(x0,y0)), you should be able to write the equation of the
tangent line (the line through (x0,y0) with slope m).  If you
write the equation of the tangent line in the form

   Y = mX + b,

then b will be the y-intercept, and you set Y=0 and solve for 
X to determine the value of the x-intercept.

You are supposed to add these two intercepts, and show that
the sum is a constant, i.e. does not depend upon x0 or y0.

Is it clear what you need to do now?

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
