Your answer of 2 would be incorrect. If you square 2, you do not get 
-4; you get 4. Therefore 2 cannot be considered to be a square root 
of -4: it is not a number whose square is -4.

I'd say that if imaginary numbers are not intended, the question will 
in some way indicate that "no solution" is an acceptable response. 
Apart from such an indication, I would say the answer is 2i or -2i.
