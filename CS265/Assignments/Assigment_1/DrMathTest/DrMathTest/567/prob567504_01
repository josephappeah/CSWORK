Hi Valerie,

So you've got the answer, but it doesn't make sense to you? 

I guess the place to start might be with 'equivalent fractions'.  Do
you understand why 1/5 and 3/15 are really just two different ways of
writing the same value?  

Suppose I multiply 1/5 by 1.  It doesn't change the value, right?

  1       1
  - * 1 = -
  5       5

(By the way, what _is_ the 'value' of 1/5?  It's just whatever we
would get if we divided 1 by 5.  A fraction is just a division that we
haven't bothered to do yet.)

If I divide any number by itself, I get 1, right?  So 3/3 is the same
as 1.  That means

  1       1   3
  - * 1 = - * -
  5       5   3

To multiply fractions, I multiply the numerators and denominators
separately:

  1       1   3   1 * 3    3
  - * 1 = - * - = ----- = --
  5       5   3   5 * 3   15

So 1/5 and 3/15 are really the same thing.  Anywhere I could use one,
I could swap it for the other.  

Does this make sense so far?
