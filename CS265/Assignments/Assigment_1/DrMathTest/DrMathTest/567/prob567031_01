For the two-person, zero-sum game (zero sum means that whatever
one person loses, the other person gains), game theory tells us
that there is a strategy that guarantees a certain result no matter
what strategy the other person chooses.

Thus if you're using this strategy, no matter how the other person
changes his stragegy, you will do at least as well.

For example, suppose we are playing a game where each of us
chooses one of the numbers 0 or 1 and writes it on a card
face down.  When both cards are down, we flip them over.
If they match, I win a dollar.  If they don't match, you win a
dollar.

If I always play 0, that's a bad strategy, since you'll catch on, and
start playing 1 all the time, and vice-versa.

But if my strategy is to randomly select 0 or 1, each with
probability 1/2, then the best you can hope for, in the long
run, is to break even.

With different-sized payoffs, the strategy will not be the same.
Suppose we play the same game, but if there are 2 1's, I get
$2.  If there are 2 0's, I get $1.  If they are different, I pay you
a dollar.

This game is to my advantage, but if I try to be greedy and always
pick 1, you'll always pick 0 and I'll lose.  In this case I should
randomly choose 0 or 1, but not equally often.  I should,
in fact, play 1 2/5 of the time and 0 3/5 of the time.

Let's see what happens then.  You decide to play 0 q of the
time and 1 (1-q) of the time.

Here are the results and their probabilities:

00:  q(3/5)      = 3q/5
01:  q(2/5)      = 2q/5
10:  (1-q)(3/5) = 3/5 - 3q/5
11:  (1-q)(2/5) = 2/5 - 2q/5

The expected payoff to me is:

( 3q/5 + 2(2/5 - 2q/5)) - (2q/5 + 3/5 - 3q/5)

= 4/5 - 3/5 = 1/5 -- the result is completely independent of
how you choose the value of q.  In the long run, I win 1/5
dollar on each game.
