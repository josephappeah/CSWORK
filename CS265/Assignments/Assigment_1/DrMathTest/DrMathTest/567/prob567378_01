Hi Doris,

You did the addition okay.  When estimating, what we're trying to do
is solve a problem that's LIKE the original problem, but easier.  For
example, we might say:

  0.6 is about the same as 1/2.
  5.8 is pretty close to 6.
  So if I add them together, I should get something close to 6 1/2. 

Which turns out to be true!  But much easier to do. 

Does this make sense?
