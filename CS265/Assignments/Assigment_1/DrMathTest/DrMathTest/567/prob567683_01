Hi Bryan,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The probability of guessing one T/F
question correct is always 50% regardless of how many questions you
already guessed and how many you have yet to guess.  So the
probability of guessing the TWENTIETH question correct is 50%, or 1/2.
 The probability of guessing ALL TWENTY questions correct is much
smaller.  In fact, the probability of guessing n T/F questions correct is

  (1/2)^n = 1/(2^n).

In the case of n=20, this is one chance in about 1 million.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
