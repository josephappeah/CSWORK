Hi Lori,

What gives is that it wasn't rounded. 

If I have a scale, and I put something on it, and the reading is 85.10
grams, and I know that the scale can be off by 0.01 grams either way,
then the measurement is just 85.10 +/- 0.01 grams. 

Basically, you're trying to read too much into it. 

Does this help?
