The population of the earth is increasing at about 1% per year,
so there are pleny more births than deaths.  The current
population of the earth is a bit over 6 billion.

Estimates indicate that (assuming we avoid nuclear war,
ecological collapse, pandemics, and so on, that the population
may get as high as 9 or 10 billion before it stabilizes and
starts to drop.

In all the industrialized countries of the world except the
United States, population is increasing very slowly and in
some cases (like Italy, for example) it is actually decreasing.
The growth is occurring in so-called "third-world"
countries, primarily.

There are plenty of scientists who are absoutely terrified
about the continued increase in world population, since
we seem already to be above the earth's "carrying capacity" --
the number of people it can support indefinately.  The
current population can only be supported because we
are rapidly drawing down the "natural capital" available
to humanity.  

We are using all the petroleum, cutting forest, eroding
farmland, drawing down aquifers, polluting water supplies
desertifiying cropland in such a way that even though
the population is growing, the actual carrying capacity
of the earth is falling.

All these topics are nicely covered (including accurate
statistics on all the information above) in a recent book by
Paul and Anne Ehrlich called "One with Nineveh".
