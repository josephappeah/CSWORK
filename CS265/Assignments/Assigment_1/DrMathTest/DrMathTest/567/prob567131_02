Hi Aditya, 

You don't need any special identities.  You just need the distributive
property.  

Note that you can rewrite 

  (3x + ab)(b+c)(c+a) 

as

  3x(b+c)(c+a) + ab(b+c)(c+a)

If you do that for all three of the terms like that, you end up with 

  3x*this + 3x*that + 3x*other + [stuff with a, b, c] = a+b+c

Can you see how to solve that for x?
