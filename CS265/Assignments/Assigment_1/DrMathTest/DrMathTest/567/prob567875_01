There are several ways in which a number can be related to a date.
Here in America, some schools have a special celebration of "pi day"
on March 14, since we write that day as 3/14, which looks like the
decimal approximation 3.14. Look for ways to write a date in August
that reminds you of SOME approximation of pi; don't forget that pi can
be approximated both as a decimal and as a fraction. And consider
whether you would write the month or the day first -- people do it
both ways.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
