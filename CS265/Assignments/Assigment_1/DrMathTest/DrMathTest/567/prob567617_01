Four of a kind [four cards of one face value and one other card]

   Number of hands =  C(13,1) x 12 x 4  =  624
                             
The terms in this expression arise as follows:

C(13,1) = number of ways of choosing the face value for the 4 cards.

12 = number of ways of choosing face value of 5th card.

4 = number of ways of choosing the suit for the 5th card.
