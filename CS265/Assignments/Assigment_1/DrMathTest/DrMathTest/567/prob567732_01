Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Logan!

Although you didn't say, I assume the "whole numbers" have to be
positive.

Then the numbers from 10 to 99 are the two-digit numbers, because
numbers smaller than 10 are one-digit numbers, and numbers bigger
than 99 are three-, four-, or more-digit numbers.  Thus there are
99 - 10 + 1 = 90 of them.  The numbers from 100 to 999 are the
three-digit numbers, and the numbers from 10000 to 99999 are the
five-digit numbers.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
