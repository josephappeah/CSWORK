I take that to mean that you meant the second of the options I gave,
that you accept that it will converge to something and you want to
know why it is the square root of two.

So your function (or transformation) takes

  a/b  to  (a+2b)/(a+b).

That is, it takes

  a/b  to  (a/b + 2)/(a/b + 1).

So we can write the transformation as

  f(x) = (x + 2)/(x + 1).

So we keep iterating

  b = f(a)
  c = f(b)
  d = f(c)
  e = f(d)
  ...

and eventually we start getting really really close to some number

  ...
  q = f(p)
  r = f(q)
  ...

where p, q, and r are really, really close together.  We know that our
function (x+2)/(x+1) is continuous, so if applying f to p and q and r
gets something really close, then applying f to the number that this
sequence approaches (the limit) will not change that number.  That is,
if the limit of this sequence is x, then we know that

  x = f(x).

Great!  Well, there are only two possibilities for such an x, because
it must satisfy the equality

  x = (x + 2)/(x + 1)

  x(x + 1) = x + 2

  x^2 + x = x + 2

  x^2 = 2

which means that x must be either the square root of 2 or the negative
of the square root of 2.  But it is easy to see that if we start with
a positive number a/b, then a/b + 2 is also positive, and a/b + 1 is
also positive, and so f(a/b) will be positive too.  So it has to
converge to the square root of 2.

In fact, it takes a little more work to show that it also converges to
the (positive) square root of two if you start with a negative number.
 The only exception is if you ever hit the number a/b = -1, because
then you'll divide by zero on the next step.

Is that what you wanted to see?
