Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Chris!

Draw a picture:

               C
               o
              /|
             / |
            /  |
           /   |
    Cross /    |
    Road /     | Main
        /   8km| Road
       /       |
      /        |
     /   6km   |
    o----------o
   B    West    A
        Road

Here you have a right-angled triangle ABC, with right angle at A
(because the roads are perpendicular).  Now use the Pythagorean
Theorem.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
