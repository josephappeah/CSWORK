Hi CB,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  There are exactly 2.54 cm in an inch,
so there are exactly 12 times that many in a foot,

  1 foot = 30.48 cm (exactly).

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
