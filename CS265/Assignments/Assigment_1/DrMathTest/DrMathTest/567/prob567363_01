Hi Caitlyn,

Thinking in terms of formulas isn't really the way to go about dealing
with problems like these.  Take a look at

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/60399.html

and be sure to read the links there, as well as the item itself. 
Write back if it's not clear, or if you still have questions. 

Does this help?
