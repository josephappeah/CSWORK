Hi Kim,

Okay, that helps.  Thanks.  Let's try massaging that description a
little more:

  A company is quoted insurance premiums of $9000 per year.  
  30% of this amount (or $2700) is made up of $100 for admin 
  fees, $80 for commissions charges.  The remaining balance
  (of the $2700, which comes to $2520) goes towards profit 
  and taxes.

Are profit and taxes equally split?  If not, there's no way to answer
the question.  

If profits and taxes are equal, then we can say that each of them is
half of $2520, or $1260.  If you triple that, you get $3780 in profit,
but it's not clear how you would just 'triple' your profits.  The
money has to come from somewhere. 

It's possible that the split between profit and taxes is supposed to
be 3 to 2, i.e., 3/5 of the $2520 is profit, and 2/5 is taxes.  In
that case, profict is (3/5)*$2520 or $1512. 

But there's really no way to know what ther person who wrote the
question intended, because it's very, very badly worded.  If it's a
real question that requires a real answer, I suggest sending it back
to the company and asking them to translate it into English.
