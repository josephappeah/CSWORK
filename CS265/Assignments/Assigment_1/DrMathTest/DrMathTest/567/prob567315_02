Hi Vicki,

That would depend on who you ask.  I think Newton and Gauss would be
on anyone's list.  If you're just asking:  Who were the best (most
capable) mathematicians, you'd want to include Archimedes.  If you're
looking for maximum impact, I think you might want to include Kurt Godel. 

Does this help?
