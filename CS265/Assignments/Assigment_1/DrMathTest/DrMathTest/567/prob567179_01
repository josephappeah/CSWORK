Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

There are a couple benefits to normalizing:

1) Ease of analysis. Once you become familiar with the properties of
the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, you develop useful
intuition about the normal distribution itself from this basic form.
If you have to constantly deal with a non-zero mean and different
variances, the intuition is harder to achieve.

2) Ease of calculation. The value of the cumulative distribution
function for a normally distributed r.v. with mean 0 and variance 1
can be found in a chart in just about any book on probability. So, if
you normalize, you can find a value of z such that F(z) = 0.95 very
easily in the text. Although we have computer software and calculators
which can numerically integrate the function quickly, sometimes a
chart is easier to use.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
