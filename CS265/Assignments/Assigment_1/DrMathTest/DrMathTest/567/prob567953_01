I take it you are allowed to combine digits into a single number, like
"91" using the 9 and the 1; and that the ten digits can occur in any
order; and that only addition is allowed.

The first thing I would do is to check whether it might be impossible.
The trick of "casting out nines" lets us check an addition problem by
adding up the digits. In this case, the sum of the digits of all the
numbers you are adding will be 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 which is 45; the
sum of those digits is 9. This tells us that ANY number you can get
this way will be a multiple of 9 (like your 99); you can't get 100 as
the answer!

If you are allowed to subtract, or if you can add and multiply,
everything changes. But if the rules are as I stated, then it can't be
done, and the point of the exercise is either to give lots of addition
practice, or to show the value of knowing some math beyond just how to
add, so that you can logically prove something impossible without
having to try every possible case.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
