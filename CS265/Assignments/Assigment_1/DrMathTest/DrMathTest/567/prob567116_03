Hi Cim,

>Rewrite cos^3(x) as an expression in sin(x) times cos(x),...

   cos^3(x) = cos^2(x) sin(x)

and you can rewrite cos^2(x) in terms of sin(x) by using

>cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) = 1 .

In your identities,

>cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) = 1

is correct.

>sin^2(x) = 2*sin(x)* cos(x) = cos(x)

The first equality is correct.  Neither expression is equal to cos(x).

>cos^2(x) = ( 1 + cos(2*x)) )/2
>cos(2*x) = ( 1 - 2*sin(x)^2 )
>cos(2*x) = cos^2(x)-sin^2(x)

are correct.  For additional identities, see
