Hi, Terry --

There are several pages in the Dr. Math archives where this problem 
is discussed.  You can find links to them by searching the archives 
using the keyword "checkerboard" (or "chessboard").

Take a look at some of those pages and write back if you then still 
have any questions about this problem.
