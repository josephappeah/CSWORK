Hi Tatiana,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The question is "what angle, added to
52 degree 14 minutes 50 seconds, will give 90 degrees, or as the
hint points out, 89 degrees 59 minute 60 seconds?".

For example, the complement of 20 degrees is 70 degrees, since
20 + 70 = 90.  The complement of 10 degrees, 30 minutes, is 79
degrees, 30 minutes, since

  10 deg 30 min + 79 deg 30 min = 89 deg 60 min
                                = 90 degrees .

Can you solve the problem now?

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
