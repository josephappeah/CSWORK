Hi Tom,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You need to use a property of
square roots:

   sqrt(a) * sqrt(b) = sqrt(a*b) .

So for example,

  sqrt(2) * sqrt(3) = sqrt(6),

and 

  sqrt(75) = sqrt(25*3)
           = sqrt(25) * sqrt(3)
           = 5 * sqrt(3) .

The latter computation allows you to simplify square roots by
removing any perfect square factors inside the radical.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
