Hi, Jon --

The bookworm obviously doesn't chew through the leftmost cover of 
volume 1 or the rightmost cover of volume 20.

The tricky part of the question lies in the fact that page 1 of each 
volume is next to the rightmost cover of that volume while page 500 
of each volume is next to the leftmost cover.

And there is one piece of information missing -- if you need to 
determine the total number of inches the bookworm chewed through, 
then you need to know the thickness of the covers.

I hope these hints help.  Write back if you have any further 
questions about this problem.
