Hello,
You are exactly right.
This kind of expression is called the "set builder" notation.
You use it to describe the elements in a set.  To the left of
the "|" is the name of a variable representing things in the
set, and to the right of it are the conditions that have to
be true about the variable for it to "qualify for membership"
in the set.  
  
You can have more than one condition, as in {x|x>5 and x<10}
which describes all values of x between 5 and 10.  In both 
your expression and my expression the inequalities are strict.
By that I mean that equality is not allowed.  If yours had
used the "greater than or equal" sign, then 5 would have been
included.  As you originally wrote it, 5 is NOT in the set.
  
So, essentially you are right.  But the purpose of the
expression is not to say something about all values of x,
but to give a description of the set which consists of
all numbers x for which this is true.
  
Hope this helps, and that your daughter likes honors algebra.
