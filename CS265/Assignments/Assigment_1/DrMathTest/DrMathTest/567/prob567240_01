Hi Tami,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  How many one-digit positive integers
are there?  What are they?  Which ones are prime?  Then you just have
to divide the number of primes there from the number of all of them.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
