Hi Nicole,

You got one out of 3.  In fact, 

  9 * 6 = 54

  8 * 4 = 32

  7 * 7 = 49

For the most part, you need to memorize the products of single digits.
 There can be some understanding involved, and there are some tricks
you can use to help you get started, but mostly you just have to learn
them through repetition.

Here is an example of a trick:  When you multiply something by 9, the
digits of the product have to add up to 9.  Check it out:

  9 * 1 =  9
  9 * 2 = 18      1 + 8 = 9
  9 * 3 = 27      2 + 7 = 9
  9 * 4 = 36      3 + 6 = 9

So let's say I want to multiply 7 by 9.  I know it can't be as much as
70, since that's 7 times 10.  So it's got to be 60-something.  What's
the something?  I need to add 3 to 6 to get 9, so it has to be 63. 

As I said, this is just a trick that you can use while practicing, but
eventually you just need to get to the point where knowing that 8
times 7 is 56 is as automatic as knowing your name or the names of
your friends.  

One way to go about committing your multiplication facts to memory is
to avoid trying to learn too many at one time.  Look at this
