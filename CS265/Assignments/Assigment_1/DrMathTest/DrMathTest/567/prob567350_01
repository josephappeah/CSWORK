Hi Cathy,

The formula on the left would work for a cone.  I assume the tank is a
cylinder (like a soup can)?  In that case, the formula on the right,

  v = area of base * height

is the one to use, but the area of the circular base will be pi times
the square of the radius.  The radius is half the diameter, so 

  v = (pi * (diameter/2)^2) * height

    = pi * 20^2 * 48

That will get you the volume in cubic inches.  To convert to gallons,
you'd need to know that there are 231 cubic inches in a gallon.

Does this help?
