Hi Melissa,

Note that a fraction is just a division that we haven't done yet.  For
example, 

  3/4

has the same meaning as 

     __
  4 ) 3

so the way to convert from a fraction to a decimal is to go ahead and
divide the numerator by the denominator:

      0.75
     _____
  4 ) 3.00
      2 8
      ---
        20
        20
        -- 
         0

So 3/4 is the same as 0.75.  

Does that make sense?
