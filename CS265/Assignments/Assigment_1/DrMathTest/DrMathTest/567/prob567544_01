I would suggest forgetting about the 'four step solution', and
concentrate on understanding the problem. 

Clearly you can't buy more than 2 pens, because 3 of them would cost you 

  3 * 28 cents = 84 cents

which is more than you have.  And clearly you can't buy more than 3
notepads, because 4 of them would cost

  4 * 23 cents = 92 cents

which is more than you have.  So that narrows the possibilities down
by quite a lot, doesn't it?  In fact, the only possibilities are

  pens   notepads
  ----   --------
    0        1
    0        2
    0        3
    1        0
    1        1
    1        2
    1        3
    2        0
    2        1
    2        2
    2        3

To get the total cost, you'd multiply the number of each item by the
cost of the item, and add:

  pens   notepads   cost
  ----   --------   ----------------
    0        1      0*28 + 1*23 = 23  (too low)
    0        2      0*28 + 2*23 = 46  (too low)
    0        3      0*28 + 3*23 = 69  (too low)
    1        0
    1        1
    1        2
    1        3        It's got to be somewhere in here...
    2        0
    2        1
    2        2
    2        3      2*28 + 3*23 = 125 (too high)

Does this make sense?  Can you find which one it has to be?  Let me
know what you come with, and I'll show you a faster way to find it...
