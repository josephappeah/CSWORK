Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Keith!

No calculus is required.

The filling pipes add 1/4 and 1/5 tankful per hour.  Then draining
pipes remove 1/3 and 1/6 tankful per hour.  That means that working
together, the pipes add 1/4 + 1/5 - 1/3 - 1/6 tankfuls per hour.
Adding these together, using common denominator 60, the pipes add
-1/20 tankfuls per hour.  That means that they remove 1/20 tankfuls
per hour, so the tank will empty itself.

I leave it to you to figure out how long it takes.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
