Hi Rhonda,

That's what was intended.  As we get into more complicated expressions
involving variables, we don't want to have to write expressions like

   2    3
  a *b*c *d*e

so by convention, if we can tell where something starts and something
else ends, we can put them next to each other and understand that
multiplication is implied, 

   2    3        2  3
  a *b*c *d*e = a bc de

This works fine if want to multiply by a number:

     2  3
  12a bc de

But if we want to put two numbers together this way, we need to have
something to say where the boundaries are:

  123xy =  1*23*xy or 12*3*xy ?
        
That's what the parentheses are for:

  (12)(3)xy = 12 * 3 * x * y

Does this help?
