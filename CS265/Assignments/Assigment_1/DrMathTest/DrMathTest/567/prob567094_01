Hello Paul,

x*dy/dx + 3y = 1/x^2

becomes

y' + (3/x)y = x^{-3}.

This is a linear, first-order differential equation.  It has an integrating factor of the form

e^{int(3dx/x)} = e^{3*ln(x)} = x^3.

Just multiply the equation by x^3:

x^3*y' + 3x^2*y = 1

We note that the left side is

d(x^3*y)/dx

So, the solution is now easy.
