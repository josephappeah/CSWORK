Hi Audrey,

When we say 'percent increase', what we're really asking is:

  The increase from 2415 to 2953 is what percentage of
  the original value, 2415? 


For example, if something increases from 200 to 300, the increase is
100, which is 50% of the original 200.  So that's a 50% increase. 

Once you realize this, you can see that to find the percentage
increase, we have to solve the proportion

  new value - old value    ?
  --------------------- = ---
        old value         100

Multiplying both sides by 100, we get

  new value - old value    
  --------------------- * 100 = ? 
        old value         

which is the formula you're looking for.  

Does that make sense?
