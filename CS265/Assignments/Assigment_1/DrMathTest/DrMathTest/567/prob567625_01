Hi, Aleks --

This seems to confuse many students the first time they do a problem 
like this....

Think about what you have done.  You have found the distance between 
the two given points, and you have divided that distance in two.

But when you divide the distance in two, the two parts are the same 
length.  You want to find a point so that the distance from P is 
twice the distance from Q.

You want the distance between the two given points to be divided 
into two parts in the ratio 2:1.  If we use the standard process for 
solving ratio problems and call those distances 2x and 1x, then the 
total length of the segment is 3x.  So we have, according to your 
calculation of the distance between the two given points,

  3x = 3 sqrt(2)
   x = sqrt(2)

Once you get to this point, however, you still need to find the 
coordinates of the point which is 2 sqrt(2) units from P and sqrt(2) 
units from Q; that involves a lot more work.

You will find this problem a lot easier to work if you work with the 
x- and y-coordinates separately.  For the x-coordinates, we have 0 
for P and 3 for Q; the difference is 3.  If we divide that length of 
3 into 3 equal parts, each on part is one unit.  So the x-coordinate 
of the point which is twice as far from P as it is from Q is x=2.  
And for the y-coordinates, we have -1 for P and 2 for Q; again the 
difference is 3, and when we divide that difference of 3 into three 
equal parts and find the y-coordinate of the point which is twice as 
far from P as it is from Q, we get y=1.

So the point we are looking for is (2,1).

Reviewing the critical parts of the process:

(1) Divide the distance between the points using a ratio.  In this 
problem, the prescribed ratio is 2:1, so we need to divide the 
distance between the given points into 2+1=3 equal parts, with the 
two resulting segments represented by 2x and 1x.  If the prescribed 
ratio were 4:3, then we would have to divide the distance into 4+3=7 
equal parts, with the two resulting segments represented by 4x and 
3x.

and

(2) Work with the x- and y-coordinates of the points separately to 
make your work easier.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
