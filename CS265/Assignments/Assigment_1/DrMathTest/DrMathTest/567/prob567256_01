                              7!
Number of combinations =  -----------  =  105
                           3!2!2! x 2

The extra 2 in the denominator is to take account of the fact that 
the pairs in the two double rooms could swap rooms without it 
counting as a different arrangement of the groupings of PEOPLE.
