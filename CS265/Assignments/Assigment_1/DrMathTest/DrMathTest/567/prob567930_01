Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Your approach is correct, but when
you say

>My thought on the question are:
>(b,a1) in f^-1 means 
>1) for all b and a1 (b = f(a1)), or 
>2) for all b there exist a1 such that b = f(a1).

(b,a1) is assumed to be a specific ordered pair in f^(-1), so you
shouldn't be talking about "for all b...".  Your options indicate
that you know the interpretation of the statement (b,a1) is in f^(-1):
the definition you give ( f^-1 =  {(b,a):(a,b) in D(f)} [I changed
the f in the predicate to D(f)]) tells you what '(b,a1) is in f^(-1)'
means: (a1,b) is in f.  Since functions are viewed as sets of 
ordered pairs, this means that f(a1) = b.  That is all you need.

You have to get the injectivity hypothesis into the problem.  To show
that f^(-1) is a function, suppose that you have two specific ordered
pairs (b,a1) and (b,a2) in f^(-1) [so that f^(-1)(b) = a1 and also
f^(-1)(b) = a2 ].  You just need to translate these two statements, 
which are about two specific ordered pairs, into statements about
f, so that you can use the hypothesis, which is on f.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
