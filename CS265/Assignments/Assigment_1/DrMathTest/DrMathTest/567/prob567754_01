Hi Patricia,

It looks like you're doing fine so far.  The perimeter of a rectangle
or parallelogram (which is what I assume you're computing) would be
the sum of the sides:

  area = a + b + a + b

Addition is commutative, so you can change the order:

  area = a + a + b + b

You can replace repeated additions with multiplications:

  area = 2a + 2b

You can use the distributive property to break out the common factor:

  area = 2(a + b)

So now, if you're given two particular values, e.g., a = 3 and b = 4,
you can substitute these into the equation to get the area for that
particular shape:

  area = 2(3 + 4)

       = 2(7)

       = 14

What is it, exactly, that you're confused about?
