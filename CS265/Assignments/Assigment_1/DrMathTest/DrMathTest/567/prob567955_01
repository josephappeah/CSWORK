I don't know that we usually talk about the altitude of a general
polygon, since it isn't very meaningful except for triangles. But if I
had to define it for any polygon, I would say the altitude with
respect to a particular side (the base) is the greatest distance of a
vertex from the line containing that base.

Can you be more specific about the kind of problem in which you have
to do this?
