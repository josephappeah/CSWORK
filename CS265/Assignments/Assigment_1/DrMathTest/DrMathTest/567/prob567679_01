Hi, Melissa --

If there are 10 questions with 2 possible answers for each one, then 
the total number of possible outcomes is not 2*10=20; it is 2^10 = 
1024.

One way to answer this particular problem is to try to analyze 
separately the two cases we are interested in -- getting scores of 
90 or 100.  The case of scoring 100 is easy; there is only one way 
to do that -- we have to get every answer right.

For the case of scoring 90, we can reason that we can only miss one 
question, and that one question could be any of the 10, so there are 
10 ways we could get a score of 90.

And so there are in all 1+10=11 ways to score either 90 or 100; so 
the probability of scoring 90 or more on the test with random 
guesses is 11/1024.

That kind of reasoning rapidly gets unmanageable when we get to case 
like getting 7 out of 10 right or 6 out of 10 right.  The general 
method of solution for problems like this is found in Pascal's 
Triangle.

The 10th row of Pascal's Triangle (the one which starts "1 10 ...") 
contains the coefficients found in the expansion of (x+y)^10.  This 
10th row is

  1 10 45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1

This means that

  (x+y)^10 = 1x^10 + 10x^9.y + 45x^8.y^2 + ... + 10xy^9 + 1y^10

To apply Pascal's Triangle to our problem, we write the complete set 
of probabilities for the outcome of each question as

  (.5r+.5w)

where the ".5r" indicates a 0.5 probability of getting the question 
right and the ".5w" indicates a 0.5 probability of getting the 
question wrong.  Then

  (.5r+.5w)^10

will give us the set of probabilities for getting different numbers 
out of 10 questions right.  We can re-write this last expression as

  ((.5)(r+w))^10 = (1/2)^10 * (r+w)^10 = (1/1024) * (r+w)^10

Now we use Pascal's Triangle to expand the "(r+w)^10" in this last 
expression, and we get

  (1/1024) * (1r^10 + 10r^9.w + 45r^8.w^2 + ...)

The "1r^10" here indicates 1 way to get 10 right; the "10r^9.w" 
indicates 10 ways to get 9 right and 1 wrong; the "45r^8.w^2" 
indicates 45 ways to get 8 right and 2 wrong; and so on.  We are 
only concerned with the case where we get either 10 right or 9 right 
and 1 wrong.  So the probability we are looking for is

  (1/1024) * (1 + 10) = 11/1024

Here is another quick example, with just the key parts of the 
process and not all the lengthy explanations.  Suppose we have 6 
questions on the test and we want to find the probability of getting 
3, 4, or 5 right.

With 6 questions, we use the 6th row of Pascal's Triangle:

  1 6 15 20 15 6 1

These numbers give the numbers of ways of getting 6, 5, 4, ..., 1, 
or 0 right, respectively.  Our problem asks us for the probability 
of getting 5, 4, or 3 right; the entries in this row of Pascal's 
Triangle we are concerned with are thus the 6, 15, and 20. And the 
probability we are looking for is then

  (1/2)^6 * (6+15+20) = (1/64)(41) = 41/64

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.  If you are not familiar with Pascal's 
Triangle, you can find many pages in the Dr. Math archives on that 
topic by searching the archives using the phrase "pascal's triangle".
