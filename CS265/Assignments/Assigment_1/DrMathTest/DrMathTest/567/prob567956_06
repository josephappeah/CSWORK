Hi Ashkan,

Are you asking me to prove that x^n + y^n = n! has no integer
solutions?  Well, I'll try.

For n=0, there are no solutions.

For n=1, there are infinitely many solutions

  (x, y, n) = (x, 1-x, 1).

For n=2, there are four solutions

  (x, y, n) = (1, 1, 2)
            = (-1, 1, 2)
            = (1, -1, 2)
            = (-1, -1, 2).

Suppose that x, y, and n are integers, n > 2, and

  x^n + y^n = n!.

If n is even, then |x| and |y| is also a solution, so we may as well
assume that x and y are nonnegative if n is even.  Furthermore, by
possibly switching x and y, we may as well assume that

  x^n >= y^n.

This also implies that

  x^n >= n!/2 > 1

(since n > 2), and since either n is odd or x is nonnegative, this
implies that

  x > 1.

Now let p be the smallest (or any) prime factor of x.  We must have

  p > n,

because if p <= n, then p divides n!, and p divides x^n, so p must
divide y^n, which means p divides y.  But x and y cannot have a common
factor, because if p divides x and p divides y, then p^n divides x^n,
and p^n divides y^n, which means that p^n divides n!.  But the largest
power of p that divides n! is

  inf        n     inf  n     n
  sum floor(---) < sum --- = --- <= n.
  i=1       p^i    i=1 p^i   p-1

So we must have p > n.  Since x is positive, and p > n divides x, that
means that

  x >= p > n,

and therefore

  x^n >= p^n > n^n > n!,

which means that

  -(y^n) = x^n - n! > 0.

This means that y^n must be negative, which means that n cannot be
even, and y must be negative.  So let

  z = -y > 0,

so that

  z^n = (-y)^n = -(y^n),

and then we have

  x^n - z^n = n!

with x and z positive.  Then we must have

  x > z,

since n! > 0 implies

  x^n > z^n,

and therefore

  x >= z+1,

which implies that

  n! = x^n - z^n >= (z+1)^n - z^n > n*z^(n-1).

But we also have

  z^n = x^n - n! > n^n - n! > 1,

which means that there is also some prime divisor p of z.  For the
same reason as before, we must have

  p > n,

which means that

  z >= p > n.

Putting this with the other, we have

  n! > n*z^(n-1) > n*n^(n-1) = n^n

which is clearly false.  QED.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
