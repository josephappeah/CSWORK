Hi Mimi,

For the first, you would probably want to start by proving that each 
of the two summands is bigger than some number.  For example, you can 
prove that

  3^(1/2) > 5/3

from the fact that both sides are positive and their squares are

  3 > (5/3)^2
  3 > 25/9
  3*9 > 25
  27 > 25.

Similarly, you can prove that 3^(1/3) > 4/3, and then from these two 
things you can get

  3^(1/2) + 3^(1/3) > 5/3 + 4/3 = 9/3 = 3.

For the other, I think the following answer from the Dr. Math archive 
will tell you what you want to know:

I found it by searching on these keywords:

  prove square root irrational

You can find other similar answers by doing the same search at

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
