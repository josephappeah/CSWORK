Hi Martin,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You are right.  In fact, you should
consider the functions

  cos(nx)

and

  sin(nx)

for the general case.  You can get this by considering the complex
roots of the polynomial

  y^2 + n^2 = 0.

Now you just need a particular solution.  The general idea is to guess
something similar to the form of the nonhomogeneous part, that is, the

  cos(mx),

so consider something like

  a*cos(mx) + b*sin(mx)

and see if you can find some constants a and b that will make this
solution work.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
