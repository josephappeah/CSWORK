It's easy to see why "nonagon", like "undecagon", is used more widely
than "enneagon" (or "hendecagon"): people are more familiar with Latin
prefixes like "nona-" and "un-" than with the Greek "ennea-" or
"hen-", so they assume they can be used here. They are not thinking
about foreign roots, but just about putting together English word parts.

As for "nonagon" being entirely Latin, I suppose you could say that,
IF it came to us from Greek via Latin, having been used in
mathematical Latin before it came into English. It would be a partial
truth (since the original roots would still be a mixture of Greek and
Latin, having simply been mixed in Latin rather than in English), but
it might justify using the term just a bit more than merely claiming
that it has been used for a long time in English. That seems to be
what is being claimed by "Eequor" (one person, not many people! -- and
his pseudonym seems to be a misspelled Latin word!).

So we just have to look up "nonagon" in a dictionary with good
etymological data, such as m-w.com:

  Etymology: Latin nonus ninth + English -gon

That's a different take on the issue! This does not support the claim
that the word came directly from Latin, though I suppose that's
possible; instead they see "-gon" not as a Greek root, but as an
English morpheme, sidestepping the mixed language question. This more
or less agrees with my first paragraph.

I find no evidence in Latin dictionaries that "nonagon" was used in
Latin (or that "enneagonon" was used in Greek).

The bigger issue is, why does it matter whether we mix roots from
different languages? A purist may prefer not to, but that doesn't
really mean it's wrong to do so, or that there are not already many
other instances of that in English.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
