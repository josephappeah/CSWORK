Hi Albert,

You seem to be ignoring my comment that your equations are wrong
in the first place. There is no point in solving those equations,
because they are the wrong equations.

If you get the right equations, you will still need to solve a
system of linear equations like these, but there will be three
variables instead of two.  

You need to use elimination to solve systems like these.  For example,
in the system above, you should subtract the two equations instead
of adding them as you did, to eliminate the variable A and obtain
an equation for B.
