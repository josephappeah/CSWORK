Hi Jordan,

Whenever we can multiply two numbers together to get a third number,
we say that the first two are 'factors' of the third.  For example, 

  1 * 12 = 12 

so 1 and 12 are factors of 12.  For some numbers, there is more than
one pair of factors:

  12 = 1 * 12
 
     = 2 * 6

     = 3 * 4               1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 are factors of 12

So the question

  What are the factors if 15?

means

  What (natural) numbers can you multiply together to get 15?

Does this help?
