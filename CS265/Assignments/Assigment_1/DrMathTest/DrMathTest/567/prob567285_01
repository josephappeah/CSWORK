Hi Ron,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  It is not possible to answer you
question with only the information you have provided.  You need to
give the specific function f(x).  How to choose @ when e is given
depends upon f(x) - it is not one choice which works for all 
functions.

You might look at 

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/53403.html

to make sure you understand the rationale of epsilons and deltas,
and some examples of how to choose delta, given epsilon.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
