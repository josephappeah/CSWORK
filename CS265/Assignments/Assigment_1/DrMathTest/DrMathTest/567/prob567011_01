This is where generating functions come to the rescue.  In this 
example you require the coefficient of x^2/2! in the expansion of

   (1+x+x^2/2).(1+x)^2

   1 + 3x + 7/2x^2 + 2x^3 + 1/2x^4

The term in x^2 is  (7/2)x^2

                = 2!(7/2)(x^2/2!)

                =  7(x^2/2!)

So there will be 7 permutations of 2 letters from ABBD
