Hi, Beth --

For a 9-year-old, the pattern should be a relatively simple one.

There is no easy pattern for the numbers you show.  However, if we 
change the "52" to "42", then the numbers are formed by subtracting 
14 each time.  Then the sequence is

  98, 84, 70, 56, 42, 28, 14, 0

And so the two missing numbers are 70 and 14.

I suspect this is supposed to be the way this problem works out.  
You probably just copied the "52" wrong when you wrote the problem 
down....
