You'll notice a link in this email where you can continue the
discussion; if you use that, the system will automatically connect
your new comment to this question, and you won't have to continually
address your question to me.  The system also notified me
automatically when you do that.

Anyway, you are correct that (p-1)^2 does not divide (p-1)! for p=3 or
p=5, which is part of why those are exceptions to the theorem.  For
p>5, however, it is true, and it is not hard to prove, since

  2 < (p-1)/2 < p-1

in those cases.  Do you see why this implies that

  (p-1)^2 divides (p-1)!  ?
