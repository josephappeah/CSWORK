Hi Victorio,

Take a look at

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58474.html

and write back if it's not clear, or if you still have questions.  In
particular, if you can tell me about a particular problem you're
having trouble solving, that would help me figure out the best way to
help you.

Does this help?
