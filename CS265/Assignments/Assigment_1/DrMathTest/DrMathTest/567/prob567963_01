Hi Patmanathen,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  I would recommend using the change
of base formula for logarithms to put everything into a common base, 
such as natural logarithms.  If b and c are positive numbers, and
log_b(x) denotes the logarithm of x to the base b, etc.,
then
              log_b(x)
   log_c(x) = --------
              log_b(c)  .

Then the statement

>log base2a a=x 

becomes

   ln(a)                   ln(a)
  ------ = x ,  or  x = -----------  .
  ln(2a)                ln(a)+ln(2)

You can similarly transform the other two log statements into 
equations involving ln(a) and natural logarithms of positive
integers, and then you can rewrite the algebraic expressions in

>xyz +1 =2yz

to an equation with ln(a) and other natural logarithms which can be
verified.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
