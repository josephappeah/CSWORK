Hi, Jenny --

You want to find the three numbers in this set which, when 
multiplied together, give you the smallest product.  Since some of 
the numbers are negative, you can get either positive or negative 
products.  The "smallest" product is thus going to be the "most 
negative" number you can get.

When we multiply positive and negative numbers, the answer is 
positive if the number of negative numbers is even; and the answer 
is negative if the number of negative numbers is odd.  In 
multiplying three positive or negative numbers together, then, we 
can have

  3 positive, 0 negative  ==>  positive answer
  2 positive, 1 negative  ==>  negative answer
  1 positive, 2 negative  ==>  positive answer
  0 positive, 3 negative  ==>  negative answer

We want a negative number; this means that in our product we need to 
use either three negative numbers or one negative number and two 
positive numbers.

Let's now find the "smallest" -- i.e., the most negative -- products 
we can get by multiplying either 3 negative numbers or one negative 
number and two positive numbers.  To do this, we for the moment 
ignore the signs on the numbers and look for the "biggest" (ignoring 
signs) numbers we can find.

There are only three negative numbers in the given set, so if we 
make a product using three negative numbers, that product has to be

  (-3)(-2)(-1) = -6

For the case where we use one negative number and two positive 
numbers in our product, we again want to choose the "biggest" 
(ignoring signs) negative and positive numbers we can find.  
The "biggest" negative number is -3, and the biggest positive 
numbers are 2 and 3 -- so the "biggest" (ignoring signs) product we 
can have is

  (-3)(3)(2) = -18

Now paying attention to the signs, this product, -18, is smaller 
than our other product of -6, so the least possible product of three 
distinct members of the given set is

  (-3)(3)(2) = -18

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
