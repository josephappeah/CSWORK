Hi,

Do you know how to find the area when given the radius?  The formula is 

  A = pi * r^2

But this is the same thing as saying that 

  A/pi = r^2

And if we know the square of a number, we can take the square root of
that to find the original number, e.g., 

    _     ___
  \/9 = \/3^2 = 3

So we can take the square root of both sides to get

    ____
  \/A/pi = r

Does this make sense?
