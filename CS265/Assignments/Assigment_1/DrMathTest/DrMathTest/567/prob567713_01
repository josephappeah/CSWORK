You can treat this as a 5 letter word with 3 letters the same.  That 
is because we keep the 3 letters C, A, T in the same order and so 5! 
would be too large by a factor of 3! just as it would be if the 3 
were all the same letter.

                             5!
  Number of arrangements =  ----  = 20
                             3!
