Well, both, really.  :^l

That is, you'll want to use an identity to reduce it to an equivalent
equation involving only sin(t), and not sin(2t).  Then you'll use
algebra to manipulate the equation so you can see what t has to be.

Look in our FAQ, under Formulas, Trigonometry, and you'll find a bunch
of identities.  Look for one that expresses sin(2x) in terms of sin(x)
and cos(x).  See how far you can get using that.  Write back if you
need more help.
