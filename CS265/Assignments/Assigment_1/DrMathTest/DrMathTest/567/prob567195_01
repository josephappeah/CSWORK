Hi, David --

There isn't much work to be done in converting base 10 DIGITS to 
base 2, base 8, or base 16; I assume what you are really asking for 
is a method for converting any number in base 10 to one of these 
other bases.

The methods for converting between any two bases are the same; here 
is a link to one page in the Dr. Math archives where the methods are 
discussed:

  Converting from Base 6 to 10 and Back
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55738.html

Please write back if you still have any questions after reading the 
discussion on that page.
