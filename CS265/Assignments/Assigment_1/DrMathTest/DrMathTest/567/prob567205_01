Hi, Caitlin --

You complicated things by intorducing the variable m representing 
the area of the triangle.  You don't need that variable.  The base 
and altitude of the triangle are b+3 and b; you can get an 
expression for the area of the triangle in terms of b by using the 
standard formula for the area of a triangle.

And the area of the square is b^2....

Put all that in an equation which says the area of the square is 18 
square inches less than the area of the triangle and you can easily 
solve for b.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
