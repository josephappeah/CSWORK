Hi Mark,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Both of your problems are solved in
the same way:  Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator,
and expand the right side, as in

  ax + b = A(cx + d)
  ax + b = Acx + Ad

and then subtract the x term on the right side to move it on the left,
and the subtract the non-x term on the left side to move it on the right:

  ax - Acx = Ad - b

Then factor out the x and divide:

  (a - Ac)x = (Ad - b)
  x = (Ad - b)/(a - Ac).

Now can you solve the other equation for z in the same manner?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
