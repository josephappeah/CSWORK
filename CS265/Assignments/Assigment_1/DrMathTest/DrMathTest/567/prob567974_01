Your "difficulty" comes closer to finding the answer than your 
"thoughts". Can you explain why you did what you did? What do these 
subtractions and additions mean?

To solve it my way, think about what that number 52 means. If the 
sets "25 or younger" and "16 or older" were disjoint (that is, had no 
members in common), then you could just add the number of people in 
each set to get the total number of people. You can't, because the 
sets overlap. How are the numbers 52 and 40 related to the size of 
the overlap?
