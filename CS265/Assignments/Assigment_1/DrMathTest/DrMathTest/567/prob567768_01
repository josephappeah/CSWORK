Hi ,
Thanks for writing to Dr. Math!

You don't need a formula; you just need to know how many liters are 
in one gallon.  (I'll assume you mean United States liquid gallon?)  
Am I correct?

1 gallon = ? liters

When you know this, you can answer this:

2 gallons = ? liters

Find a conversion at the following link:

Does this help?
Please write back if you need anything else.
