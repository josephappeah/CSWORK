Hi Karisa,

Let's look at your original problem:

  x + 5 for x = 4

When we write an expression like

  x + 5

it's just a very compact way of saying

  some number + 5

For example, I might say:  I have some amount of money in my pocket,
and you have 5 dollars.  How much do we have together?

Without knowing just how much I have, you can say that the total
amount is 

  whatever I have in my pocket + 5

right?  So we're just condensing 

  whatever I have in my pocket 

to a single letter, x, and writing

  x + 5

Now, suppose I fish around in my pocket and say, Oh, it turns out I
have 4 dollars.  How much do we have together?  Well, now you know
that that the x stands for 4, so you replace the x with 4 and get

  4 + 5 

which is just 9.  

That's all that's going on here.  Does it make sense?
