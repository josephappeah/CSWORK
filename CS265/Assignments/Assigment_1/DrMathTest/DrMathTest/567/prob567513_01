Hello Eva,

Let p, a, and s be the number of pineapples, apples, and strawberries.

5p+a+0.05s=100
p+a+s = 100

and all p, a, and s must be positive integers.

This system has infintely many solutions (not all  integer solutions).  We can the system  
for p and a in terms of s  (think of s as a constant).  We find

p = (19*s)/80

a = (-(1/80))*(-8000 + 99*s)

For p to be an integer, we see that s must be 80 or 160 or ...

So, we try several values:  if s=80, then p=19 and a=1.

If you need to work out the solution of the sytem I gave, please write back.
