Hi, Sharmila --

>19200-14400=4800 rent diff

This is a good start.  The "base" rent for the 12 months is 14400; 
the total rent was 19200, so the difference between those two 
numbers is the rent resulting from the amount of business over 
150,000.

>150,000 + 4800= 158,000

This would be the final step if the "4800" were the amount of 
business over 150,000.  However, it is not that amount of business --
 it is 4% of that amount of business.  You need to figure out how 
much business was done over 150,000 if 4% of that amount was 4800.

People have different ways of handling percent problems.  The most 
common seems to be to write the information as

  "x out of y equals z percent"

or, equivalently,

  "x out of y equals z out of 100"

This translates directly into a proportion problem:

  x    z
  - = ---
  y   100

In our example, we have that 4800 is 4% of some total; we need to 
determine that total.  The "x out of y" is 4800 out of some unknown 
amount "a"; the "z percent" is 4%:

  4800    4
  ---- = ---
    a    100

Solving this proportion gives us the amount of business over 150,000 
as 120,000.  This is the number you add to 150,000 to find the total 
amount of business -- which is 270,000.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
