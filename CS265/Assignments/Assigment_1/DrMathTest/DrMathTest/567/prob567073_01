Hi Kathy,

Generally the difference between 'applied x' and 'x' is that the
former is about finding ways to use 'x' without necessarily
understanding it, while the latter is about gaining a deeper
understanding of 'x' without really caring about its usefulness. 

Does this help?  Or have I misunderstood your question?
