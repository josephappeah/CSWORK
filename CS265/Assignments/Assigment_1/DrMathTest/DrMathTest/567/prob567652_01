The inputs required by trigonometric functions such as sin() can 
depend on the system (computer language, calculator, spreadsheet, 
etc.) involved, but most often, trig functions take arguments in 
radians and inverse trig functions return values in radians. In 
dividing by 57.2958, you are converting from degrees to radians (1 
radian becomes 57.2958 degrees) which is the correct thing to do, 
unless your trig functions happen to take arguments in degrees. I 
doubt that they take arguments in degrees-minutes-seconds; I have 
never seen this. However, you'll have to check the manual or help 
system to know for sure.

I can see no error in what you are doing. The abs() functions 
shouldn't be needed, but they shouldn't hurt, either. Also, I notice 
that your two formulas use different values for the radius of the 
earth. I use 6367 km, but since the earth is not a perfect sphere, 
any choice will produce error somewhere on the globe -- not the kind 
of error you're seeing, though.

Perhaps you can send me sample data you are using and the results you 
get, including intermediate results. I can compare with what my 
formulas produce, and possibly tell where the error is occurring. But 
you'll have to know your own system, how the trig functions work.
