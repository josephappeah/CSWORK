Hi Patmanathen,

I gave you the expression for x obtained from

>log base2a a=x  ,

namely

   ln(a)                   ln(a)
  ------ = x ,  or  x = -----------  .
  ln(2a)                ln(a)+ln(2)

Can you write

>log base3a 2a=y
>log base4a 3a=z 

in similar forms, using the change of base formula?
