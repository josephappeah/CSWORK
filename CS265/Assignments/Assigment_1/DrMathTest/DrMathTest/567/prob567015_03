Hi,

Exactly what you did for part (3), where you have listed all the 
possible forms for a 2x3 matrix in reduced row echelon form, just
use a 2x2 matrix instead.

For (3), suppose R is one of the forms listed.  Take the first one,
for example.  What are the solutions of

  [ 0 1 0 ][ x ]   [ 0 ]
  [ 0 0 1 ][ y ] = [ 0 ]   ?
           [ z ]   [ 0 ]

If you have a non-zero solution v of this equation, and it is also 
a solution of Sv = 0, could S be any of the other five forms?
