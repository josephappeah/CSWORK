Hi Mukundan,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I think the sum you are asking about is

  inf  n^2
  sum -----
  n=1  7^n

Am I right?  Three terms isn't much to base that on, but I'm guessing
that's what you want.

Have you ever summed an "arithmetico-geometric series"?  That is, one
of the form

       k
  S = sum a * n * r^n  ?
      n=1

Some people do this by taking derivatives, but I won't assume that you
know calculus, and I'll do it the algebraic way:  Subtract r*S.

             k                 k
  S - r*S = sum a * n * r^n - sum a * n * r^(n+1)
            n=1               n=1

             k                k+1
  S - r*S = sum a * n * r^n - sum a * (n-1) * r^n
            n=1               n=2

                            k+1
  S - r*S = a * 1 * r^1 + [ sum a * r^n ] - a * k * r^(k+1)
                            n=2

and then the middle series is a geometric series, and I assume that
you can sum a series like that.  This gives you a formula for S - r*S,
and then you just divide both sides by 1-r to get S.

Well, you have a series of the form

       k
  S = sum a * n^2 * r^n
      n=1

In fact, you can sum it in exactly the same way:  Subtract r*S,
regroup the sums, divide by 1-r, and you will get a formula for S
which has an arithmetico-geometric series on the right, the type that
I already solved.  Use the formula for that kind of series to get the
formula for your kind of series.

And then take the limit as k approaches infinity.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
