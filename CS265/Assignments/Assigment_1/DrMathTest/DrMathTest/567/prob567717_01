Let x = number of hats   y = number of shirts

Then  4x + 6y = 80

      2x + 3y = 40

You require solution of this equation in positive integers for x and 
y.  One method is to plot the straight line 2x + 3y = 40 and where 
this line passes through points (x,y) where both x and y are 
positive integers you will have solutions to the problem.

Since 2x and 40 are both even we can see at once that y must be even.

So solutions could be
                                                 y=       x=
                                                Shirts   Hats
                                               ---------------
 y=2  x = (40-3y)/2  =  (40-6)/2 = 34/2 = 17      2       17

 y=4  x = (40-12)/2   = 14                        4       14

 y=6  x = (40-18)/2   = 11                        6       11

 y=8  x = (40-24)/2   =  8                        8        8

 y=10 x = (40-30)/2   =  5                       10        5

 y=12 x = (40-36)/2   =  2                       12        2

These are all the possible solutions.
