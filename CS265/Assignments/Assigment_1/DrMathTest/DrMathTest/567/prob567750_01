Hi,

I think the following answer from the Dr. Math archive will tell 
you what you want to know: 

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58778.html

and

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/59119.html

I found it by searching on these keywords:

  chisanbop

You can find other similar answers by doing the same search at

The method works by treating the ten fingers as a sort of abacus. It
works just fine for numbers up to 100. 

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
