Hi Shakira,

The pieces don't have to be the same size.  Notice that if
you have a half-doughnut, you can slice it into three pieces
by cutting across the hole.

You can obtain as many as 18 pieces with proper alignment.

If the doughnut is a normal one, namely three-dimensional,
I think it's possible to get 14 or 15 pieces even if you don't
rearrange them.  With rearrangment, I think that the best
you can do is still 18.  The problem without rearrangement
is quite difficult to visualize, however.
