Hi Elizabeth,

It's not so much an equation as an observation.  The area of a
triangle is half the product of the base and the height.

Suppose we have two legs of a triangle, of lengths 6 and 7.  We might
arrange them like 

      \                  |                /
       \7                |7              /7
        \                |              /
   ------    or    ------    or   ------
      6               6              6

right?  Now, the greatest height will occur in the middle, when the
second side is straight up.  Then the area is 

    (1/2) * base * height

  = (1/2) * 6 * 7

  = 21 

So that rules out the third choice, doesn't it?  Now you have to
consider whether the first choice can work.  

How small can you make the area of this triangle, by adding a third side?
