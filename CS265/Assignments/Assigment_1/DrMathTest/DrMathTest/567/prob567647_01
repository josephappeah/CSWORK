Hi Stefanie,

Let's look at a number like 12, and see if we can find pairs of
numbers that we can multiply together to get it:

  12 = 1 * 12
   
     = 2 * 6

     = 3 * 4

So we say that 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 are all 'factors' (or 'divisors')
of 12.  Another way to say this is that a factor of 12 is any natural
number that evenly divides 12.  

Does this make sense?
