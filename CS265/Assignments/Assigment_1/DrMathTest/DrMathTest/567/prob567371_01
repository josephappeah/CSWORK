Hi Glenn,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.If you think of antidifferentiation as
the inverse process of differentiation, then since differentiating
e^(2x-4) just multiplies the function by 2 (the derivative of (2x-4),
then antidifferentiating should do the inverse process, which would
be to divide the function e^(2x-4) by the factor 2.

More generally, you can use the Substitution Theorem to keep track
of the algebra.  The Chain Rule says that

   f(g(x))' = f'(g(x))*g'(x) ,

so

   /
   | f'(g(x))g'(x)dx = f(g(x)) + C  .
   /

If you can write an integral in the form on the left (which involves
identifying f and g, then you can write down the antiderivative using
this formula.  We often write such a problem in the following way:

  /
  |e^(2x-4)dx
  /

Here, if we take f(u) = e^u, and g(x) = 2x-4, then f'(u) = e^u,
and g'(x) = 2, so 

  /                   /
  |e^(2x-4)dx = (1/2) | e^(2x-4) * 2 dx
  /                   /
                            ^      ^
                            |      |
                         f'(g(x)) g'(x)

so you can apply the Substitution result.

This is often written in the following shorthand: let u = 2x-4,
and then we can write symbolically 

        du
   du = -- dx = 2 dx   (in this case, since du/dx = 2)
        dx

or

   dx = (1/2) du

so we replace e^(2x-4) by e^u, and dx by (1/2)du, giving

  /             /
  |e^(2x-4)dx = | e^u (1/2)du
  /             /

                      /
              = (1/2) | e^u du
                      /

              = (1/2) e^u + C

              = (1/2) e^(2x-4) + C .

The symbolic differential calculations take care of all the
"bookkeeping" for you, so the substitution theorem is a very
useful result for finding antiderivatives.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
