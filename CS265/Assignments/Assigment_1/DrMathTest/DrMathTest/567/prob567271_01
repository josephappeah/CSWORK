Hi Leroy,

It's hard to say what you should study without knowing what kinds of
questions you missed on the exam.  But if numbers and letters scare
you, it might be useful for you to read the following items from our
archive:

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/62905.html
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57312.html

Write back if they're not clear, or if you still have questions.  If
you have a practice exam, you can pick one question off of it and show
me how you would try to answer it on your own.  That will help me see
where you're having problems.
