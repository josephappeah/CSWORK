Hi Alex,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Suppose you have three sequences a(n),
b(n), and c(n), and for all n they satisfy the inequality

  a(n) < b(n) < c(n).

(In your case, c(n) is a constant, but a constant sequence is also a
sequence.)  If it also happens to be true that all three of these
sequences converge

  a(n) -> A
  b(n) -> B
  c(n) -> C,

then it is easy to prove that

  A <= B <= C,

which is exactly the fact that the Squeeze Theorem uses.  But it is,
in fact, NOT true in general that

  A < B < C,

and you have already pointed out one counterexample that demonstates
this fact.  Other counterexamples are easy to create, such as

  1 - 1/n < 1 < 1 + 1/n

for all n, whereas all three of those sequences converge to 1.
