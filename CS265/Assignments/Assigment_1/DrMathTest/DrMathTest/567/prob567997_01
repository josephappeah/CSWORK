Hello   Chris,

If you can draw lines 1 and 2, which are perpendicular to each other, and can figure out he 
radius r of the column (in feet), you can lay out the circle or any part of it.

If you move out on line 1, going x ft from the post, then you are x+r ft from the center.  If 
you then move upwards, parallel to line 2, a distance of sqrt(625-(x+r)^2), you will be on 
the circle.  

You will need a calculator.  If, for example, r=0.75 ft and x=0.5 ft, then
x+r=1.25.

(x+r)^2 means multiply x+r by itself:  1.25*1.25=1.5625

Subtract this from 625:

625-1.5625= 623.4375

sqrt(623.4375) means take the square root of 623.4375 .  Most calculators have a square 
root button.

sqrt(623.4375=24.97 ft.
