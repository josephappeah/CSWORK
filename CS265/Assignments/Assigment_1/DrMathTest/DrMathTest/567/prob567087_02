Hi Iris,

He might be trying to make the point that certain ideas are merely
conventions, i.e., they're true only because we all agree to accept
them.  

Note that when constructing scales of any kind, we get to make some
choices arbitrarily, while others are 'made for us' by the world.  For
example, the world tells us that water will freeze at one temperature
and boil at another.  But it doesn't tell us what numbers to assign to
these temperatures.  

So we're free to say that water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212
(giving us the Fahrenheit scale), or that it freezes at 0 degrees and
boils at 100 (giving us the Celsius scale), or that it freezes at 273
degrees and boils at 373 (giving us the Kelvin scale).  

I could make up the 'Ian' scale, and say that water freezes at e
degrees, where e is the base of the 'natural logarithm',

  e = 2.71828...

and boils at pi degrees, where pi is the ratio of the circumference of
a circle to its diameter (in a Euclidean space),

  pi = 3.14159...
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.pi.html

and no one could say that this is 'wrong'.  The most anyone could say
is that it's not useful enough to convince anyone to switch over from
one of the other systems already in use. 

Similarly, in dealing with dates, the world tells us that certain
things happen at certain intervals.  For example, we know that the
orbit of Mercury precesses (wobbles) at a certain rate, and we know
that the earth orbits the sun at a certain rate.  So we could, for
example, decide to start counting years when the orbit of Mercury was
in a certain configuration; and having made that choice, the number of
orbits of earth that have occurred since then is determined by the
world.  But we could choose to start counting at a different time. 

So the answer to 'What year or day is this?' is completely arbitrary,
can have any answer that we agree on.  

But the answer to 'How much time elapsed between [some] naturally
occurring periodic event and [some other] one?' is arbitrary only in
the sense that we get to choose our units.  

On the other hand, your daughter's teacher may not understand any of
this, and he might have some other 'explanation' in mind, which may or
may not make sense.  If you'd like to write back and let me know what
'explanation' he offers, I'd be happy to discuss that with you.
