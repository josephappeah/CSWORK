That's right. In real life, if I were reading the number to a lab
partner for example, I would read it "thirty point zero six two eight"
to make it clear; but if I were asked to read it as a fraction, or to
write it out for legal purposes, I would write "thirty and six hundred
twenty-eight ten-thousandths".

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
