Hi Richard,

To find the percentage, you want to compare each to the total.  That
is, the percentage of red is found by solving the proportion,

              34                 ?
  --------------------------- = ---
  34 + 2 + 345 + 112 + 73 + 3   100

which you can do by multiplying both sides by 100:

              34                  
  --------------------------- * 100 = ?
  34 + 2 + 345 + 112 + 73 + 3   

So that's the 'formula' you'd want to use.

Does this help?
