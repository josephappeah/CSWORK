Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Greg!

Try this web page from our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):

  Segments of circles
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.circle.segment.html

You know s and h, so you're in Case 3 from that page.  The answer
will have to be determined numerically, since there is no algebraic
formula for r in terms of s and h.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
