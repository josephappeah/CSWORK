Hi, Priscilla --

If Lakesha is 3 times as old as Jerry, then we can let

  x = Jerry's age

Then it must be true that

  3x = Lakesha's age

Then the problem tells us that the sum of their ages is 72.  So you 
can solve the equation

  x+3x=72

to find the value of x.

Then remember that just "x" is not the answer to the problem.  The 
answers are Jerry's age and Lakesha's age.  Jerry's age is x; 
Lakesha's age is 3x.
