Hi, Sam --

Whenever you have a fraction, it is good form to write the fraction 
in lowest terms.  To reduce a given fraction to lowest terms, you 
need to find  all the common factors between the numerator and 
denominator and cancel them.

So to simplify the answer in the type of problem you have here, you 
don't want to multiply the expressions together to get higher-degree 
polynomials -- you want to do exactly the opposite: factoring every 
expression in the problem... and hoping that there are some common 
factors in the numerator and denominator.

In your specific problem, we have

  3x^2-27           18-6x
  --------    /    --------
  x^2+4x+3         x^2-x-2

     3x^2-27   x^2-x-2
  = -------- * -------
    x^2+4x+3    18-6x

   3(x+3)(x-3)   (x-2)(x+1)
 = ----------- * ----------
   (x+3)(x+1)      6(3-x)

It appears there are several common factors between numerator and 
denominator, so this expression will simplify considerably.  I leave 
the rest of the work to you....

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
