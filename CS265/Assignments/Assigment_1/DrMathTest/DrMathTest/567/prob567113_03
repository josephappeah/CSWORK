The answer is shown again below.

          60 x 5280
 60 mph = ---------  =  88 ft/sec
            3600

The train has to travel = 1200 + 2640 =  3840 feet at 88 ft/sec

     Time = 3840/88

          = 43.64 secs

The numbers arise as follows

I have converted speed in mph to speed in ft/sec and I have 
converted miles into feet.  So all the work is in feet and seconds.

   5280 = number of feet in a mile
   3600 = number of seconds in an hour.

This leads to result 60 mph = 88 feet per second

Train has to travel = 1200 feet + 1/2 mile

                    = 1200 ft + 2640 ft

                    =  3840 feet

speed of train = 88 ft/sec

            distance      3840
   Time =  ---------   =  -----  =  43.64 secs.
             speed         88
