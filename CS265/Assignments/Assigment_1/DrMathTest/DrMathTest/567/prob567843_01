Hello Mathewzhao,

Usually, one lists spherical coordinates of a point P in the order (rho,theta,phi),  where rho 
is the distance from the origin to P, theta is the angle through which the positive x-axis 
must be rotated (towards the positive y-axis) to coincide with the projection of P into the 
(x,y)-plane, and phi is the angle through which the positive z-axis must be rotated (in the 
plane determine by the z-axis and the line joining the origin to P) to go through P.

So, theta is like longitude (but theta varies from 0 to 2pi and longitude varies from 0 to 
180, in two directions from the Greenwich meridian).  Phi is like latitude, but phi varies 
from 0 to pi and latitude varies from 0 to 90 in the two hemispheres and in the opposite 
direction.

It's not easy to give a better, simple examples of the use of spherical coordinates.  There 
are many examples from physics.  If one heats an iron ball and asks how the temperature 
varies on the inside as a function of time t, then spherical coordinates are by far the best 
and simplest coordinate system to use.
