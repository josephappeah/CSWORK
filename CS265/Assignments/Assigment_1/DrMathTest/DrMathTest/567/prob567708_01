Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Jorge!

Corresponding parts of similar figures are similar, but not
necessarily congruent.  To prove similarity, all you need is that
the corresponding angles are congruent.  That stays true for parts
of figures if it is true for the whole figure.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
