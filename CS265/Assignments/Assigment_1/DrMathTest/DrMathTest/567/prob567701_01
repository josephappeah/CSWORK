Hi Jennifer,

A quarter is one-fourth of a dollar, i.e, 1/4 of a dollar.  If you
have 2 quarters, that's 2/4 of a dollar.  So if you add a quarter to
two quarters, you have

  1/4 + 2/4 = ?

It's pretty clear that you're going to end up with 3 quarters, right?
 So that would be 

  1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

which is to say, when you have two fractions that have the same
denominator, you can add them by adding the numerators. 

Does this help?
