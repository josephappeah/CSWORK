Hi, Maggie --

This question is easier to understand if we say it as "the absolute 
value of x equals the opposite of the absolute value of x".

An absolute value is 0 or positive; the opposite of an absolute 
value is either 0 or negative.  The only time the two can be equal 
is when x=0.

We can also approach this problem algebraically.  We have

  |x| = -|x|
  |x|+|x| = -|x|+|x|
  2|x| = 0
  |x| = 0
  x = 0

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
