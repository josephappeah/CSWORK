Hi, Amber --

RP and RA are not congruent, because RP is not tangent to the circle 
(except in the one case where point A is the "midpoint" of arc PQ).  
I made the same mistake when I first drew my diagram of the 
problem....

Here's a sketch of how I would prove this:

(1) Draw segment AO where O is the center of the circle
(2) AO is now parallel to RP (why?)
(3) AOP is isosceles (why?)

Now work with angles of an isosceles triangle and angle formed by 
parallel lines cut by a transversal to finish the proof.

I hope this much helps you finish your proof.  Please write back if 
you need more help with any of this.
