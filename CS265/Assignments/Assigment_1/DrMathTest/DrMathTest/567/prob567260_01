Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Fahimeh!

The proof of that a straight line which is not vertical has an
equation of this form uses the theory of similar triangles.

Let (0,c) be a point on the y-axis which is also on the line.  Let
(x,y) be a point on the line, and (X,Y) another such point.  Then
the ratio (y-c)/(x-0) = (Y-c)/(X-0) is a constant, because the right
triangle with corners (0,c), (x,y), and (x,y-c) is similar to the
right triangle with corners (0,c), (X,Y), and (X,Y-c).  Call that
constant ratio a, and then you have

   (y-c)/x = a,
   y = a*x + c.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
