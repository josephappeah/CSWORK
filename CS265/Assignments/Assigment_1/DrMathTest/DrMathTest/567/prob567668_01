Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Avneesh!

You need to use the definitions of convergence of a sequence to a
limit and of the continuity of the function f(x).

Pick epsilon > 0.  Then use the continuity of f(x) to find a value
of delta > 0, such that for all x with |x-L| < delta,
|f(x)-f(L)| < epsilon.  In particular, substituting x = a(n), one
has f(x) = f(a(n)) = b(n).  Then use the convergence of a(n) to L
to find an N > 0 such that for all n > N, |a(n)-L| < delta, and
that implies that |b(n)-f(L)| < epsilon.

You fill in the details.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
