Hi Janet,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It is >.  Notice that the big end is
where the bigger number is, so when you write

  a > b

then a is the bigger number, so we say "a is greater than b."  And
when you write

  a < b

then b is the bigger number, so we say "a is less than b."

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
