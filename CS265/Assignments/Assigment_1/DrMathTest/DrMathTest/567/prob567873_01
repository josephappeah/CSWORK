Hello Jodi,

The distance between two lines is measured in a direction that is perpendicular to both.

There are several ways to calculate this distance.  One way is to write the equation of a line 
that goes through a point on one of the given lines and is perpendicular to that line.

So,  the line 3x-y=0 goes though the origin and has slope 3.  The slope of a line that is 
perpendicular is -1/3.  So

y-0=(-1/3)(x-0)  or 3y=-x.

Solve this simultaneously with the other line: 3x - y + 4 = 0.  That will give you a point.  
Finally, calculate the distance between (0,0) and this point.
