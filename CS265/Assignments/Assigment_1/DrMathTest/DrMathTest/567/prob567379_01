Hi, David --

You need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers 
4, 10, 3, 8, and 15.  There are many ways to go about finding an LCM 
of a large group of numbers; I usually just start by finding the LCM 
of the two which look the "worst" together and then see if I need to 
increase that LCM because of the other numbers.

The last two numbers in the group, 8 and 15, have no common factors, 
so their LCM is 8*15=120.  And 120 is a multiple of 4, 10, and 3 -- 
so the LCM of all these numbers is 120.  So all the people can 
arrive on the same day once every 120 days.  20 weeks is 140 days, 
so there will be at least one day and at most two days in those 140 
when they can all arrive on that same day.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
