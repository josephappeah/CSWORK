What EXACTLY did the problem say? Your statements are confusing to 
me, mainly because I don't know what kind of "rate" you are looking 
for. The speed is itself a rate, with units of distance divided by 
time. What units would "the rate of a car accident" have? One could 
ask, for instance, how many car accidents occur per mile of driving, 
but this will not depend on the mass of the car. Also, was there 
anything in the problem that would tell me where the number 200 came 
from?
