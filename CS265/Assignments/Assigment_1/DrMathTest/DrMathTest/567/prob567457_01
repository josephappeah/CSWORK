Hi Matt,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Um, yes and no.

It is true that you are almost certainly not going to find someone 
who gives you a list of high school math problems and tells you 
they'll pay you $10 an hour to work the problems out.

However, it is not true in the sense that if you want to get a job 
that pays well, you almost certainly WILL NEED to be comfortable 
doing high school level math.  Doctors, lawyers, architects, 
buisinessmen, engineers and almost every other profession you will be 
expected to be comfortable with math so you can focus on the details 
of your job.

You can find information about why math is important for different 
professions here:

  Why Study Math?
  http://www.mathforum.com/dr.math/faq/faq.why.math.html

I encourage you to read through all of that page, it is filled with 
very helpful information.

And if you would like to write back with a specific profession you're 
considering, I'd be happy to explain why high school math is vital 
for succeeding in it.

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
