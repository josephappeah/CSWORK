If you typed just what you meant, the answer is zero, because a DC-8 
needs just as long a runway as a DC-8.

If one of those DC-8's was supposed to be a DC-7, you have not 
provided enough information to answer the question. Was there perhaps 
an earlier question that contained information about the runway 
requirements of a DC-8?
