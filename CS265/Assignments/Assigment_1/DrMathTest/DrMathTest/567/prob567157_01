Hi Michele,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You are right to use the Pythagorean
theorem

  Pythagorean theorem
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.pythagorean.html

So I guess you just need to know which of your answers was right.  It
helps to draw a picture:

                                                      B
                                                      |
                                                      |
                                                      |
                                                      |
                                                      | 8 mi
                                                      |
                                                      |
                                                      |
                                                      |
    L ---------------------- X ---------------------- L
    |            6 mi                   6 mi
    |
    |
    |
    |  8 mi
    |
    |
    |
    A

So now the two cars A and B are at opposite ends of a right triangle
with one leg of length 12 miles and one leg of length 16 miles.

So the distance is

  sqrt(12^2 + 16^2) = sqrt(144 + 256)
                    = sqrt(400)
                    = 20.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
