Hi Jesse,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  If x=10m, then the goat can graze
three quarters of a circle of radius 10m, right?

If x=20m, then the goat can graze three quarters of a circle of radius
20m, as well as one quarter of a circle of radius 5m where the rope is
flat against the 15m side of the barn and has another 5m of slack to
reach the other side.

Is x=30m, then the goat can graze three quarters of a circle of radius
30m, plus one quarter of a circle of radius 15m, plus one quarter of a
circle of radius 5m.

Is x=40m, then the goat can graze three quarters of a circle of radius
40m, plus one quarter of a circle of radius 25m, plus one quarter of a
circle of radius 15m.

Does that make sense?  If you have any questions about this or need
more help, please write back and show me what you have been able to
do, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
