Hi Mary,

What's dumb?  Math, or this question?

I agree that the question is kind of dumb.  For the most part, math
isn't used in everyday life, unless you're a scientist or engineer (or
maybe an economist).  You might use arithmetic once in a while, but
even then, more and more situations are being arranged so that you
don't have to do that.  

For example, it used to be that if you wanted to shop for the best
price on different sizes of the same thing, you needed to be able to
divide prices by ounces or other units, so you could figure out the
best 'per unit' price.  Now almost everyone prints that on the shelf,
along with the total price.  

But math itself isn't dumb at all.  It's true that you can get along
in the world without doing much math; but as a rule of thumb, the more
math you know the more easily you can do just about anything.  That's
because math is, in some ways, about learning to find the laziest ways
of getting things done.  People who don't know much math have to do
things the hard way, spending a lot more time and effort than are
really necessary.
