Hi Bidemi,

Yes, a rational number is a fraction p/q, where p and q are integers.

>2. Are all integers inclusive in the set of rational numbers

Yes, because any integer p can be written as the fraction p/1.

The number pi/2 is a fraction, but it's not a rational number, because
pi isn't an integer.  

Does this help?
