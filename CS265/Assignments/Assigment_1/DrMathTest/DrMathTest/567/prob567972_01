Hello John,

If you have calculated that it takes 4 hours to fill a 20 by 10 by 8 ft pool, then the filling 
rate is  20*10*8*7.5 gal per 4*60 minutes.  This is 50 gal per minute.

But it took 4.5 hours; so  20*10*8*7.5 gal per 4.5*60 minutes.  This is 44.44 gal per 
minute. 

So just subtract these two rates (and round).
