Hello, Regina --

The formula you are using,

  tn = a + (n-1)d

gives you the n-th term of the arithmetic sequence with first term a 
and common difference d.  You need to use this formula in this 
problem; however, what you are concerned with is when the sum of the 
numbers of a sequence reaches a particular number -- in this 
particular problem, the number of kilometers between Timbuktu and 
Casablanca , which is 1710.

For the sum of the numbers in an arithmetic sequence, you need the 
formula

       (first + last)
  Sn = -------------- * (n)
              2

(NOTE:  I like to put this formula in this particular form -- with 
the "first plus last" divided by 2, then multiplied by the number of 
terms "n".  In that form, the formula simply says that the sum of 
the terms of an arithmetic series is the average of the first and 
last terms, multiplied by how many terms there are.  This formula 
works because in an arithmetic sequence the numbers are "evenly 
distributed", which means that the average of all the numbers is the 
same as the average of the first and last numbers.  So then the 
formula simply states the obvious fact that the sum of a bunch of 
numbers is equal the average of all the numbers multiplied by how 
many there are.)

You talked about looking at one of the two sequences; specifically, 
you mentioned the sequence for the first car, which travels, on 
successive days, 60, 58, 56, ... km.  I have two comments about that.

First, we could consider the sequences for the two cars separately; 
but we are really concerned with the total distance covered by the 
two cars each day.  So instead of working with two separate sequences

  60+58+56+54+...
  75+72+69+66+...

I would work with the sequence formed by the sums of these two 
separate sequences:

  135+130+125+120+...

The other comment is a small but important one.  You said the common 
difference in the sequence for the first car was 2; of course it is 
in fact -2, because it is going fewer km on each successive day.

So we need to find the value of n for which n terms of the series

  135+130+125+120+...

is equal to 1710.

We can do this using formal algebraic methods.  Using the formula 
for the sum of the terms of an arithmetic series shown above, we have

       (first + last)
  Sn = -------------- * (n)
              2

The first term is 135; the n-th term is

  tn = a + (n-1)d

  tn = 135 + (n-1)(-5) = 140 - 5n

And our formula for the sum of n terms is now

       135 + (140 - 5n)       275n - 5n^2
  Sn = ---------------- * n = -----------
                2                  2

We want to know when this sum is equal to 1710; so we have


  275n - 5n^2
  ----------- = 1710
       2

  275n - 5n^2 = 3420

  55n - n^2 = 684

  n^2 - 55n + 684 = 0

  (n-19)(n-36) = 0

  n=19 or n=36

It takes the two cars 19 days to meet, having traveled a total of 
1710km.

It is curious to consider what the meaning is of the answer "n=36".  
If the cars continue in the same patterns, the numbers of km each 
car drives become negative -- so the cars start retracing their 
steps, and again on the 36th day they meet, now both traveling in 
reverse...!!  But I doubt the person who contrived this problem 
intended for us to find that solution.

To finish the problem (to find out how far from Timbuktu the cars 
meet), you need to use the Sn formula to find the sum of the first 
19 terms of the series for the car which left Timbuktu,

  60+58+56+...

The algebra involved in solving this problem by the preceding method 
was not pleasant; in particular, it did not look as if the quadratic 
equation

  n^2 - 55n + 684 = 0

was going to factor nicely.  Especially considering the need at the 
end to do more work to find out how far the car from Timbuktu had 
traveled when the cars meet, I think it would be easier to solve 
this problem just by looking at the sequences of numbers:

       car from  car from   car from    car from     total
       Timbuktu  Timbuktu  Casablanca  Casablanca  both cars
  day    today     total      today       total    together

  19       24       798         21         912       1710

That took a long time to type out, but it would take less time to 
write out -- and it takes less time than to do the algebra shown 
above.  This method also gives us the answers to both of the 
questions -- the cars meet after 19 days, with the car from Timbuktu 
having traveled 798 km.

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
