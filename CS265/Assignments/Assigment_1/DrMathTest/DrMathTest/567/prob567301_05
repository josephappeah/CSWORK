Hi Angelo,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  So I think what you are saying is: 
Take a tetrahedron (triangular pyramid), and place a new tetrahedron
on each of the four faces, so that the face of the first tetrahedron
becomes the base of the new one.  Is that what you are describing?  If
that is correct, then the best way to get the volume is probably to
add up the volumes of the five tetrahedrons involved.  Of course,
you'll have to know the lengths of the edges to calculate the volume.
 If all lengths are equal, so that all five tetrahedrons are
identical, then the volume is just five times the formula from
"regular polyhedron" or "tetrahedron" at

  Formulas: Geometric
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/

And in this case (all lengths are equal), the figure is not convex. 
If the four new tetrahedrons are shorter than the first tetrahedron,
then use the formula for "pyramid" from the above site for those
volumes.  If the height h of the pyramid is small enough, the the
figure will be complex.  If h is too big, then it will not.

Is this the figure you wanted?  Since it has 12 faces, it is a
"dodecahedron" but not a "regular dodecahedron."

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
