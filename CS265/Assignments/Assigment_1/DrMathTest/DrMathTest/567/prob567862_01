There is no solid answer to your question because I don't know the 
characteristics of the pool of women from which you selected her, or 
the pool of men from which she selected you. Marriage doesn't work 
quite the same as the probability puzzles about selecting a marble 
from a bag containing 5 red marbles and 3 green marbles, or whatever.

Suppose, though, that you would only marry someone within two years 
of your own age, and nothing else entered into the decision -- you 
made a random selection (her choice doesn't matter in this poor 
model, she's just a marble). Then you are choosing out of a pool of 
women with birth dates within a 4-year or 1461-day period, so the 
probability that you picked someone with your birthdate is 1 in 1461.

That's about the best I can do, and I hope you won't take it too 
seriously. Somewhere there may be actual statistics about how many 
marriages in some state or country are between people with the same 
birthdate; that would give you a more reliable answer than any 
calculation I could do.
