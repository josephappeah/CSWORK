Hi Destiny,

That's a _really_ good question!  Arithmetic is a very, very small
part of mathematics, which is concerned with a few basic operations
that can be peformed on numbers, where the numbers are defined in one
particular way. 

Mathematics is very, very general.  It's about how you make up rules
and trace out the consequences of those rules, spotting patterns and
trying to distinguish between patterns that seem to be true and
patterns that you can _prove_ to be true:

Does this help?  Write back if it's not clear, or if you still have
questions.
