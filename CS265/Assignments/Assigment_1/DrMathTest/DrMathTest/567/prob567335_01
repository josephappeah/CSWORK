Hi,

I don't know what it means, either.  It sounds like something some
teachers made up, but it's not something you'd actually need to know
to get along in the world, or to communicate with mathematicians.

Having said that, '215 million' looks like a pretty good guess.  I
certainly don't have a better one.
