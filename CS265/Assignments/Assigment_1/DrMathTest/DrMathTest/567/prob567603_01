I take it you're not the 15-year-old. (You did right in giving your 
daughter's age rather than your own, we don't care how old you are!)

Guessing is a bad way to go. You can use your guess, though, as a 
model for writing equations which you can then solve. You don't know 
the amount invested at 5%, so call it x instead of guessing a number. 
Then the interest earned on this portion is 0.05x. The amount 
invested at 7% interest is (6000-x). Replacing the other elements of 
your sample calculation with expressions in x will result in an 
equation. Try it.
