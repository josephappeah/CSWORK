Hi Megan,

Sometimes the best thing to do is make up a simpler problem with
numbers that are easier to work with, and use those to find a pattern
you can use with more complicated numbers. 

For example, suppose he drives at 10 miles per hour, and lives 20
miles away.  How long would it take him to get to work? 

What if he lives 10 miles away, and drives 20 miles per hour? 

Try those, and let me know what you come up with.
