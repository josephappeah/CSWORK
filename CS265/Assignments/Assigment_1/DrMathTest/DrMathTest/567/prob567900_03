Hi Alex,

Did you look at the link I sent you last time?  That will give you
close enough estimates.  It is based on the following idea:

  1/(k+1) < INT[1/x]dx from k to k+1 < 1/k

and therefore

  INT[1/x]dx from k to k+1 < 1/k < INT[1/x]dx from k-1 to k

and therefore

  b+1  1        b   1     b   1
  int --- dx < sum --- < int --- dx
   a   x       i=a  i    a-1  x

and if you have trouble with the inequality in this form, then write
it instead as

   b   1       b-1  1
  int --- dx < sum ---
   a   x       i=a  i

and

   b    1     b   1
  sum  --- < int --- dx
  i=a+1 i     a   x

which gives

   b   1        1     b   1     1     b   1
  int --- dx + --- < sum --- < --- + int --- dx
   a   x        b    i=a  i     a    a-1  x
