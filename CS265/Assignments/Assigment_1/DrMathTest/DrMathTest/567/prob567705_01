Hi Anthony,

I'm not sure what you mean. You might be asking about how to represent
one minute using 'hours:minutes' notation, e.g., 3 hours and 12
minutes is '3:12', and 6 hours and 4 minutes is '6:04'.  If so, then a
minute would be 0 hours and 1 minute, or '0:01'. 

Does this help? Or have I misunderstood your question?
