Hi Karlie,

One way to approach it is to show that the only way to get a
terminating decimal is for the denominator (after the fraction has
been reduced to simplest terms) to have only powers of 2 and 5 in its
prime factorization, e.g., 

  3   1
  - = -
  6   2    <-- 2^1

  3
  - 
  8        <-- 2^3

  7
  -- 
  25       <-- 5^2

The reason is that if it's going to terminate, there's got to be some
integer such that 

  numerator     numerator * something
  ----------- = ---------------------
  denominator     some power of 10

If you've got anything other than 2's and 5's in the prime
factorization of the denominator, there's no way you can get a power
of 10 on the right side.  

Does that help?
