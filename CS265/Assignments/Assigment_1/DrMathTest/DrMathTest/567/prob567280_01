Hi,

You're perfectly free to do that, but you should probably get into the
habit of using parentheses to delimit the substitution, e.g., 

  -16 - -20 = -16 - (16 - 36)

            = -16 - 16 + 36

If you just substitute without the parentheses, you end up with

  -16 - -20 = -16 - 16 - 36


which is a very different thing. 

The whole idea of equality is that if the statement 

  -20 = 16 - 36

is true, then anywhere you see something on one side, you can
substitute the thing on the other side without changing the truth of
the statement you're substituting into, e.g., 

        -20
   x = y

        (16-36)               This is okay because -20 = 16 - 36
   x = y

        16     36
   x = y   /  y

Does this help?
