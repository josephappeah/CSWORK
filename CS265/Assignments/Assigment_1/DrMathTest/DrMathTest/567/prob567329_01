This is confusing to us, too, because different schools and different 
books teach different rules for this sort of expression.

You know, I hope, that 7(2) means 7 times 2. The question is whether 
you first divide 35 by 7, then multiply the result by 2, or first 
multiply 7 by 2, then divide the result into 35.

I assume that when you put the words "divided by" they stand for the 
division symbol, with the two dots and the line between them. If the 
division were expressed like a fraction, with 35 above the fraction 
bar and 7(2) below, then it would be clear: you evaluate the 
expression above the bar and the expression below the bar, then do 
the division.

If the expression uses the line-and-two-dot symbol, I must say that 
mathematicians would be unlikely to write something like that -- 
partly because people would differ on how to interpret it.

The usual rule is that an expression containing only multiplication 
and division is evaluated from left to right (so in this case, you 
would first divide 35 by 7, then multiply by 2).

However, SOME people have an exception: when a multiplication is 
expressed by putting the two factors side by without a multiplication 
symbol (the parentheses are a grouping symbol, not a multiplication 
symbol), you do that multiplication before any other multiplications 
or divisions.

It's up to you to find out whether your book and teacher use this 
special rule or not. I hope this awfully complicated answer is some 
help to you! Let me know if you still have trouble after you have 
found out which rule your class uses.
