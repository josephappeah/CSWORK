Hi Donna,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Subtraction should also be done left
to right, so that

  20 - 7 - 3 - 2 = 13 - 3 - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8,

and it would be INCORRECT to do it from the right, as in:

  20 - 7 - 3 - 2 = 20 - 7 - 1 = 20 - 6 = 14.

Is that what you wanted to know?  If you have any questions about this
or need more help, please write back and show me what you have been
able to do, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
