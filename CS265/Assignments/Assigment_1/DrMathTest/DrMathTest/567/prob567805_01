Hi,

If you know how many inches something is, you can convert to
centimeters by multiplying by 2.54, because there are 2.54 centimeters
in an inch.  

If you know how many centimeters something is, you can convert to
inches by dividing by 2.54, for the same reason. 

Is this what you wanted to know?
