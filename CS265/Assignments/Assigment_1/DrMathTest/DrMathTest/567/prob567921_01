A lot of people don't remember formulas. We've put a lot of them
together into a FAQ:

  Formulas: Geometric
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/

But that may be too dense for you!

There's one essential detail missing from your question: what shape is
the glass? I can probably assume it is cylindrical; a rectangular
glass is rare (though that's the case in which you would give the
dimensions the way you did), and the fact that a real glass is not
quite cylindrical, but is really a frustum of a cone (see the FAQ!)
won't make a huge difference.

So the formula we want is

  V = pi r^2 h

which means that the volume of a cylinder is pi (about 3.14) times the
square of the radius times the height. Our radius is half the
diameter, or 1.5 inches, and our height is 6 inches, so

  V = 3.14 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 6 = 42.39 cubic inches

Now we have to convert cubic inches to FLUID ounces. (An ounce is a
weight, which we could only find if we knew what fluid you have.)

For that, you have to look up the definition of fluid ounce; our FAQ
has a section near the bottom with links that will either convert for
you, or tell you the definitions of units. I'm going to let you try
doing that part yourself to get some mental exercise; feel free to
write back if you need help!
