I can't answer your question for several reasons: (1) You have used 
some non-standard characters that my computer displays as gibberish; 
you'll have to use plain ASCII text. (2) The equation you give is 
just the definition of a function, which has no "solutions". Do you 
mean "real zeroes", which are solutions of the equation kx + 2k = 0, 
or something like that? (3) The function seems too simple for the 
question you are asking; perhaps you have left something out.

Please write back and make the question clearer.
