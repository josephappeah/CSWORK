Hi Reavon,

You are so close, and the right side, 4(x+5) is correct.  But the 
left side is not.  I think the following answer from the Dr. Math 
archive will help you figure out the part that is incorrect: 

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57538.html

I found it by searching on these keywords:

  translat

I used "translat" instead of translating or translated so that it 
gives search results for both.

You can find other similar answers by doing the same search at

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
