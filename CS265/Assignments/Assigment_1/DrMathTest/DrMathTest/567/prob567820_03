Hi Alina,

Well, you have the right idea, but your father would technically be 
correct due to the spacing.

If the problem is written -23 -9, that is just 2 negative numbers 
next to each other.  If there were parentheses around one or both, i.e., 

  -23(-9) or (-23)(-9)

it would indicate that they're supposed to be multiplied. 

If you write it -23 - 9, you then have a -23 minus 9, which would 
be -32.

I hope that this helps a little bit, and if you have any other 
questions or need any other help, let me know.
