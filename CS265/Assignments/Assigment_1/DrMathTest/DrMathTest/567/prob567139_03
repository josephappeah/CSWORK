Amisha,
This problem is most definitely a combinatorics problem.  And, since
order doesn't matter, that tells us it's a combinations problem.  So
before we do anything, let's recall the formula for combinations:

                  n!
 ncr(n, r) = -------------
             r! * (n - r)!

Here, ncr(n, r) is the choose function.  In the context of your
problem, n is the number of possible messages and r is how many are
sent simultaenously.  What we need to do is add all these up for r =
2, 3, ..., n.  To help us out with this, there's another formula from
combinatorics:

 ncr(n, 0) + ncr(n, 1) + ... + ncr(n, n) = 2^n

This is where the 2^8 number comes from in the study.  However, it's
not QUITE right because you don't want to include the ncr(n, 0) and
ncr(n, 1) terms.  So let's subtract those from both sides and see what
we get:

 ncr(n, 2) + ncr(n, 3) + ... + ncr(n, n) = 2^n - ncr(n, 0) - ncr(n, 1)

To simplify this, we can compute ncr(n, 0) and ncr(n, 1) explicity. 
Let's first look at ncr(n, 0):
                  n!
 ncr(n, 0) = -------------
             0! * (n - 0)!

               n!
           = ------
             1 * n!

           = 1

We can do the same for ncr(n, 1):

                   n!
 ncr(n, 1) = -------------
             1! * (n - 1)!

                  n!
           = ------------
             1 * (n - 1)!
     
           = n

Putting it all together, we get:

 ncr(n, 2) + ncr(n, 3) + ... + ncr(n, n) = 2^n - n - 1

This is almost consistent with the results that you computed by hand.
 If n = 3, the total number of simultaenous messages is 2^3 - 3 - 1 =
8 - 3 - 1 = 4.  For n = 4, the total number is 2^4 - 4 - 1 = 16 - 4 -
1 = 11.  You got 10, but you forgot the combination ABD.

I guess this just goes to show that you shouldn't believe everything
you read in those studies!  :-)
