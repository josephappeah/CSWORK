Hi Sah,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  In general, the solution space of a
single equation in 3-space will give you a surface (meaning
two-dimensional, like a plane), rather than a curve (meaning
one-dimensional, like a line).  So a line is either written as the
intersection of two planes, or, more commonly, in parametric form like
you have done.  Of course, you *CAN* turn the former expression (two
simultaneous equations) into a single equation like this:

  (ax + by + cz + d)^2 + (a'x + b'y + c'z + d')^2 = 0.

I expect you can see why this is really just two simultaneous
equations.  Also, there are infinitely many planes that go through a
single line in 3-space, and you only have to pick two different ones,
which means that there are MANY ways to choose the coefficients in the
above equation.

All that is to say, while you CAN write a line as a single equation,
really the general equation for a line is the parametric form you
wrote down.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
