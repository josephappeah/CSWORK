Hi, Roxanne --

I don't know what you mean when you say you "multiplied each letter 
by 6...".  The correct answer is 720, which is 6! ("6 factorial") 
which means 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720.

The formal mathematical way to approach this problem is as follows:

You have six blanks to fill (the six letters in the word); you have 
six letters to use to fill those blanks.

(1) You have 6 choices for the first letter to put in one of the 
blanks.

(2) For each of those 6 choices you had for the first letter to put 
in one of the blanks, you have 5 choices for the second letter to 
put in another of the blanks.  This gives you a total of 6*5 ways to 
fill two of the six blanks.

(3) For each of those 6*5 choices you had for the first two letters 
to put in two of the blanks, you have 4 choices left for the third 
letter to put in another of the blanks.  This gives you a total of 
6*5*4 ways to fill three of the six blanks.

...

And so on, until all the blanks have been filled with one of the 
letters; the total number of ways of doing that will be 6*5*4*3*2*1 
= 720.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
