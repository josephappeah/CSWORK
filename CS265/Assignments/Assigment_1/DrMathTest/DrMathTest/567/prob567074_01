Hi Shanno,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The idea is to pour water back and
forth between the two jugs to measure other quantities.  For example,
fill the three-pint jug and dump it into the five-pint jug.  Now fill
the three-pint jug again and pour exactly enough to fill the five-pint
jug, and you've just measured out exactly one pint in the three-pint
jug.  Do you get the idea?  See if you can extend this idea to get
exactly four pints.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
