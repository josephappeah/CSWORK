Hello Pedro,

I must have a different edition of Apostol than you, but I think the arguments are the 
same.  The Y is a function of x.  For each x in [a,b], one can use the Mean-value Theorem 
to find Y such that

( f(x,y) - f(x,y_0) )/ (y - y_0 )  =   D_2 f(x,Y) .

Because, by assumption, D_2 f is continuous on [a,b] X [c,d], it is uniformly continuous 
there.  Let eps > 0 be given; there is a del >0 for which

|D_2f(u,v) - D_2f(p,q)| < eps

provided (u,v) is within delta of (p,q).

OK, in the integral int(x=a,x=b,D_2f(x,Y)*dx), break [a,b] into subintervals 
a=x_0<x_1<...<x_n=b  less than del in length. Write the integral as a sum of integrals on 
the subintervals.  Use the uniform continuity of D_2 f, which makes of the integrands less 
than eps*length of the subintervals.  Add all of these to get eps(b-a).
