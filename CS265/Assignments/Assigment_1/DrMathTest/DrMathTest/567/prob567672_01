Hi Jynee,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  A function is inherently parameterized
already.  The value that you pass into the function is the parameter.
 For example, for the function

  f(x) = 3x + 1

the parameter is x.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
