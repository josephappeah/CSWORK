Hi Lindsay,

You can't compare trig functions unless they have the same arguments.
 So when you look at something like
  
  sin(10x) = 2 sin(5x) cos(5x)

you need to either get an argument of 5x on the left, or an argument
of 10x on the right... or you could just try getting everything down
to x on both sides.  

One useful trick is to substitute simpler expressions for more complex
ones.  For example, suppose we substitute u = 5x.  Then we get

  sin(2u) = 2 sin(u) cos(u)

which is actually something you'd find in a table of identities, e.g.,
the one at

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.trig.html

So at this point, you might be done, unless you're supposed to prove
the identity

  sin(2u) = 2 sin(u) cos(u)

Are you supposed to do that?
