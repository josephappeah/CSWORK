Hi Gladys,

If it's dropped from 64 feet, and it bounces half that high, then on
the first bounce, it bounces 32 feet.

  Bounce   Height
  ------   ------
     1      32 ft

Now it's the same as if you started from 32 feet.  It will bounce half
as high, so we have

  Bounce   Height
  ------   ------
     1      32 ft
     2      16 ft

From here, he's just a matter of adding more rows to the table until
we get to the 8th bounce. 

Does this make sense?  Can you take it from here?
