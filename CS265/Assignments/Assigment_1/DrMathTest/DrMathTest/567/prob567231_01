Hi, Gary --

Another writer sent this same type of question just a few days ago.  
After a bit of thought, I found an easy way to solve this type of 
problem.

To understand the solution process, let's take a different example.  
Let's say I want a shape which has perimeter 10 units and area 4 
square units.

I'm going to start with a shape which has the required perimeter and 
try to modify it so it has the required area; you will see shortly 
why I do this.  To get a perimeter of 10, I can have a rectangle 
with dimensions 2x3:

  *************
  *   *   *   *
  *************
  *   *   *   *
  *************

This rectangle has perimeter 10; but it has area 6.  I want an area 
of 4.

But look what happens when I cut a square out of one of the 
corners:  the perimeter stays the same, but the area is reduced by 1:

  *********
  *   *   *
  *************
  *   *   *   *
  *************

This shape still have perimeter 10, but it has area 5.  To get my 
desired shape with perimeter 10 and area 4, I need to cut one more 
square out of some corner.  There are several ways I can do that:

  *****                  *****          *********
  *   *                  *   *          *   *   *
  *************  or  *************  or  *************
  *   *   *   *      *   *   *   *          *   *   *
  *************      *************          *********

These shapes all have perimeter 10 and area 4, as required.

So for your problem, you need to start with a rectangle with 
perimeter 12.  It can be either 3x3 or 2x4.  (Note it can't be 1x5, 
because we can't cut "corners" out of a rectangle which is only 1 
unit wide.)  If you start with a 3x3 rectangle, that's an area of 9 
square units; to get the desired area of 6 square units, you need to 
cut a total of 3 squares out of some corners.  Or if you start with 
a 4x2 rectangle, then that's an area of 8 square units, so in that 
case you only need to cut 2 squares out of some corners to get the 
desired area of 6 square units.

I hope this helps.  I hope you have fun with this -- you might try 
seeing how many different shapes you can get using this method which 
satisfy the requirements of the problem.
