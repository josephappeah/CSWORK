Hi Minnie,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It sounds to me like each boy should
receive

  $230,000.00 / 3 = $76,666.67

but one of them already received $22,000.00 of his portion, and so he
still needs to get

  $76,666.67 - $22,000.00 = $54,666.67

Does that make sense to you?  Of course, Dr Math is not the place to
come if you are seeking legal advice.  That said, if you have any
questions about this or need more help, please write back, and I will
try to offer further suggestions.
