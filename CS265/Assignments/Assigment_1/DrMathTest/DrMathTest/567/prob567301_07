Hi Angelo,

From the information you provided (the eight vertices), either of
those missing edges could be considered correct.  In other words,
knowing the coordinates of all of the vertices of a polyhedron does
*NOT* determine the polyhedron, nor does it determine its volume.  You
need more information than that.

If the missing edge is d-g, then the easiest way to calculate the
volume would be to add the volume of the cube at the bottom (with side
length 1) to the pyramid above that with vertices h, d, g, and

  (0, 0, 1).

If the missing edge is h-c, then you can start with that volume and
then add the volume of the pyramid with vertices h, d, c, g.  You can
get the formulas for the volume of a cube and a pyramid from the link
I sent last time.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
