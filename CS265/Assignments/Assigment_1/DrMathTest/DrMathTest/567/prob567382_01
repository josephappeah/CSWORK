Hi, Shelli --

For young students, I like to think of this problem on a number line.

Adding two numbers on a number line is represented by

(1) starting at zero;
(2) adding the first number by moving to the right, starting at
    zero and moving the required number of marks to the right; and
(3) adding the second number by starting at the first number
    and moving the required number of marks to the right

Subtracting two numbers on a number line is represented by

(1) starting at zero;
(2) adding the first number by moving to the right, starting at
    zero and moving the required number of marks to the right; and
(3) subtracting the second number by starting at the first number
    and moving the required number of marks to the left

The only difference between these two processes is that, after you 
find the first number on the number line, you move right from there 
if you are adding the second number but move left from there if you 
are subtracting the second number.  Since you are moving the same 
distance right or left when you are adding or subtracting that 
second number, it must be true that the first number is halfway 
between the two places where you end up when you add or subtract the 
second number.

When you add the two numbers in your example, you end up at 15; when 
you subtract them, you end up at 3.  The distance between 3 and 15 
is 12; half of that distance is 6.  So the point halfway between 3 
and 15 is 3+6=9 (or, if you like, you can think of it as 15-6=9).

So the first number must be 9.  And we have seen that 15 is 6 more 
than 9 and 3 is 6 less than 9, so the second number must be 6.

In a few years, when you study algebra, you will learn a formal 
mathematical way to solve a problem like this; and you will discover 
that the formal method is very similar to the informal one I 
described.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
