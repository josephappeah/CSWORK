Hi Anne,

Thanks for writing to Doctor Math.

My mom is from Cadillac, MI. She grew up on Haynes street across 
from the high school.

Without the bundle order your cost would have been

       2 * 37.05 + 2 * 42.35 = 158.80

If we assume that your savings are proportional for both cartridge 
types then your bundled cost is 141.34 / 158.80 = 0.89 times the 
unbundled cost.

This makes your prices

           color: 0.89 * 37.05 = 32.98
           black: 0.89 * 42.35 = 37.69

I rounded the color price up a fraction of a penny to make the final 
answers match your actual total cost.

Does that make sense? Write again if you need more help.
