Hi Mike,

I'm glad you're interested in finite fields.  I'll go through and
answer each part of your message in turn.  So see below:

Suddenly I'm beginning to doubt that statement I made.  Actually, I
think you're right that this is true over a field of characteristic 2.

That's (2^k)-1 and not 2^(k-1), right?

That's right.

I thought you just did that.

Oh, wait!  I think the confusion here is that you are trying to get
from the theorem that adding one root gives you the same field to the
theorem that making a splitting field gives you the same field.

The easiest way to make this connection is to prove that:

Z(a) is the splitting field for your polynomial P(x).

Then the two theorems are equivalent.  Does that make sense?

You mean k > m > n >= 0.

Unless a=0, but that's a pretty trivial case, easily ruled out (what
would P(x) have to be?).

Um, almost.  It is true that a^(2^k - 1) = 1 as long as a is nonzero,
but that does NOT imply that the order of a is 2^k - 1, only that the
order divides 2^k - 1.  And then the order of a divides 2^n(2^q-1),
not vice-versa like you were using.  For example, a root of the
irreducible polynomial

  x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1

over GF(2) has multiplicative order 21, not 63 as you might expect. 
The multiplicative group is cyclic, but the root a (in this case) is
NOT a generator for the group.  For many polynomials, called
"primitive polynomials," a root *IS* a generator for the
multiplicative group, but not for all polynomials.
