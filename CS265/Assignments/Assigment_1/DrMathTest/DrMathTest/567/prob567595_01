Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

How is the square root if -1 impossible? It has been defined for you.
The Greeks believed the square root of 2 being irrational was
impossible. As an electrical engineer, I assure you that 'j' is
perfectly acceptable and incredibly useful in electrical engineering.
Many of the insights and theory we develop in EE would not really be
possible without it.
