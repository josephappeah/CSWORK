Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

If you know the product of two roots is -32, and the product of the
other two roots is 62, you can decompose the polynomial:

    x^4 - 18x^3 + kx^2 +200x - 1984

  = (x^2 + mx - 32)(x^2 + nx + 62)

Now, expand the polynomial on the right hand side:

    (x^2 + mx - 32)(x^2 + nx + 62)

  = x^4 + (m+n)x^3 + (30 + mn)x^2 + (62m - 32n)x - 1984

From here, you have a system of equations:

       m+n = -18
   30 + mn = k
 62m - 32n = 200

You have three equations and three unknowns. You just have to solve for k.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
