Hi Ariel,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  First of all, you should be careful
when "applying the 1's complement" - for example, do you get the same
thing when you apply it to

  1111

as when you apply it to

  001111 ?

Those are the same binary numbers.  In truth, the 1's complement of a
positive binary number should have infinitely many 1's to the left of
the leftmost digit.

But I would recommend not thinking of binary numbers in those terms
unless you are dealing with how COMPUTERS do the arithmetic.  The 1's
complement is a way of representing a sign when computers only have 0s
and 1s (no signs).  If you are doing it on paper, you would be better
off thinking of them as normal everyday numbers in base 2.  How would
you do the subtraction in base 10?

  670000
  - 1234
 --------

Well, first you would borrow a ten from the second column, who needs
to borrow one from the next column, on out to the 7.  Then you subtract:
       1
  669990
  - 1234
 --------
  668766

You can do the same thing in binary:

  110000
  - 1111
 --------

You can't take 1 away from 0, so you need to borrow a 2 from the
second column, who needs to borrow another 2 from the next column, and
so on out to the 1.  Then you subtract:

  101112
  - 1111
 --------
  100001

Does that make sense?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
