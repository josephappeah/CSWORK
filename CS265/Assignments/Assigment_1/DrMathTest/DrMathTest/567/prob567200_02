There are several ways you could go about it. One common way is first 
to multiply through by the least common multiple of all the 
denominators. This will get rid of the denominators and make a more 
familiar equation. The common denominator of 20, x, and 8 is 40x; 
multiplying both sides by 40x gives

  40x(1/20 + 1/x) = 40x*1/8
  (40/20)x + 40x/x = (40/8)x
  2x + 40 = 5x

Then you can subtract 2x from each side, to get both x's on the same 
side so they can be combined:

  40 = 5x - 2x
  40 = (5 - 2)x
  40 = 3x

Then we have a one-step equation. Are you OK from here?

Another approach is to first solve for 1/x:

  1/20 + 1/x = 1/8
  1/x = 1/8 - 1/20
  1/x = 5/40 - 2/40
  1/x = 3/40

Then you can invert each side (take the reciprocals):

  x = 40/3
