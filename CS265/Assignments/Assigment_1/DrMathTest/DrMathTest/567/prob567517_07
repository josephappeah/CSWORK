Hi Tryna,

Bookstores and libraries are full of math books.  How can you find the
one that's right for you?  Here's one way:

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52354.html

Another way would be to simply contact the publishers of the book
you're using now and tell them you want to buy the next two or three
in the series.  Or ask an 8th grader for the name and author of his
book, and buy a copy of that.  Or check with your local library to see
if you can get a copy through inter-library loan. 

If you're ready for algebra, you can find pretty much the entire high
school curriculum online here, 

  http://sosmath.com/

although you might not find the explanations as detailed as you'd
like.  (When that happens, check the Dr. Math archives for material to
fill in the gaps.)  If you're not sure whether you're ready for
algebra, go through their review section, and see if you know
everything in that section.  If so, you're ready!

As for competitions, here are some places you can start looking:

  http://www.moems.org/
  http://camel.math.ca/Exams/competitions.html

If you want something at a lower level, you should consider our
Problems of the Week,

It's not really a competition, per se, but it's a good way to prepare
for competitions:
