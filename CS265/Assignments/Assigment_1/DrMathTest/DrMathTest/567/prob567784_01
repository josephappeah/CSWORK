Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Lily!

Let the number of cows be C and the number of ducks D.  Make two
equations, one for number of animals, one for number of legs:

   C + D = 22,
   4*C + 2*D = 56.

Then solve these two equations in two unknowns for C and D.

By the way, your answer is wrong.  6 ducks and 16 cows would have
12 + 64 = 76 legs, not 56.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
