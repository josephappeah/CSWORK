Hi Jan,

The first thing to realize is that when we write 

  11D

that's just a lazy way of writing

  11 times D

So you're starting with 

  11*D - 4*D + 1*D = -8

So far, so good?  Okay, now suppose we change it around a little:

  11*5 - 4*5 + 1*5 = ?

We could go ahead and do three multiplications, and then add the
products... or we could use the distributive property, which would let
us do three additions and one multiplication:

  (11 - 4 + 1)*5 = ?

             8*5 = ?

              40 = ?

Does this look familiar?  Back to the original equation.  Since D is
just a number whose value we don't know yet, we can do the same thing:

  (11 - 4 + 1)*D = -8

Does this help?
