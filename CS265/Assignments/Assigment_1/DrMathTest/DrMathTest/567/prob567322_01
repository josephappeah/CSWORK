Hi Taryn,

So perhaps you wrote down your chart incorrectly, which I will copy here:

3...8
4...11
4...14
5...17
6...20
7...23

a.  What is the second number, if 50 is the first?
b.  What is the second number if 200 is the first?
c.  What is the first number if 89 is the second?
d.  If n is the first number, what is the second?

If you meant to write

3...8
4...11
5...14
6...17
7...20
8...23

Then I would agree that if n is the first number, then 3n-1 is the
second number.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
