Hi Chase,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It is something historical, and 
something cultural.  Some people write a 1 (one) as a single vertical 
line, while others put a hook on the top, and still others put a hook 
on the top as well as a horizontal line on the bottom.  For those in 
the second category, other people might think this looks like a 7 
(seven), so generally the people who put a hook on their 1s (ones) 
also draw a horizontal line through their 7s (sevens) so as not to get 
them confused.  And then some people just like the way that looks 
anyway, and so they draw the line through the 7 even if they draw 
their 1s differently.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write 
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to 
offer further suggestions.
