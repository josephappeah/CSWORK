Hi,

The matrices are either rank 1 (with only one non-zero row) or rank
2, with two non-zero rows.  If a matrix is of rank 1, there are three
possible positions for the pivot (ther first non-zero entry in the row),
and if it is of rank 2, the there are three possible positions for the
column which doesn't contain a pivot, so there should be six possible
forms in all.

However, if the matrix is rank 1 and the pivot is in the first column,
the form should be

  [ 1 a b ]
  [ 0 0 0 ]

instead of

  [ 1 0 0 ]
  [ 0 0 0 ]  ,  etc.
