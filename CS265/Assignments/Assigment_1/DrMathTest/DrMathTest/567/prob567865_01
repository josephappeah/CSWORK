It is a help to realize the shape of the cubic curve.  

If the term in x^3 is positive the graph disappears to y=-infinity 
as x -> -infinity and it disappears to +infinity as x -> +infinity.
Inbetween there is an S shape with a maximum followed by a minimum 
as x increases.   Find the coords of the turning points by 
differentiating and equating to zero.  If the max is above the x 
axis and the minimum below the x axis there MUST be 3 real roots.  
If both turning points are below the x axis or both are above the x 
axis then there will be only one real root.  There is ALWAYS one 
real root because the graph must cross the x axis at some point.

If the minimum turning point occurs with x positive then the largest 
root is also positive.  Similarly if the maximum point occurs with x 
negative the smallest root is also negative.

If the quadratic formed from dy/dx = 0 has no real roots then there 
are no real turning points (the curve does a little wiggle without 
ever sloping down) and in this case there will definitely be just 
one real root of the cubic.

If you have a clear visual picture of the curve it is easy to answer 
questions on the nature of the roots.

Turning now to the actual questions, we had

   y = x^3 - 12x - 7.2 = 0

  dy/dx = 3x^2 - 12 = 0

                x^2 = 4     x = +-2

The max point occurs with x = -2 and y = (-2)^3 - 12(-2) - 7.2
                                       = 8.8

The min point occurs with x = +2 and y = 2^3 - 12(2) - 7.2
                                       = -23.2

If you consider the shape of the curve, it has a maximum turning 
point at (-2, 8.8), it crosses the y axis at -7.2 (so it has crossed 
the x axis between x=-2 and x=0 and then reaches the minimum turning 
point at (2, -23.2).  From this description we know the curve has 
come from -infinity crossed the x axis somewhere left of x = -2 has 
reached the max point (-2, 8.8) then turned down crossing the x axis 
again and passing through the point (0, -7.2) before reaching the 
minimum point at (2, -23.2).  From here it turns up and crosses the 
x axis at some positive value of x as it heads off to +infinity.  
This shows without doubt that there are two negative roots and one 
positive root.  


The second question relates to  y = x^3 - 3x^2 - 2 = 0

    dy/dx = 3x^2 - 6x = 0

        3x(x - 2) = 0   so x = 0 and x = 2 are turning points

By similar arguments to those given above we know the minimum 
turning point is at x = 2

If there is a positive root to the cubic this turning point must be 
below the x axis.

  When x = 2   y = 2^3 - 3(2^2) - 2
                 = -6

So minimum turning point is at (2, -6) and the positve root must be 
to the right of this point.  To show that it lies between x=3 and 
x=4 all we need do is show that f(3) is negative and f(4) is 
positive.

    f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 2

    f(3) = 27 - 27 - 2  = -2  (so negative)
    f(4) = 64 - 48 - 2  = 14  (so positive)

This means that somewhere between x=3 and x=4 the curve crossed the 
x axis at the largest positve root of the cubic equation.  This MUST 
be the largest positive root because another positive root would 
require that the curve has another minimum point to the right of 
x=2.  And before that there would have to be another max turning 
point.  This would require that we had a polynomial of degree 5.
