Hi Jim,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The best you can do is 11.  Let me try
to explain why:  Start with a circle.  That's one piece.  We draw a
line across the circle, and we have split that one piece into two
pieces.  Draw another line across the circle, and we will either split
one piece or both pieces into two pieces each, leaving a maximum of
four pieces.  Draw a third line.  Can we split all four pieces?  No,
because we can only cross each of the other two lines once, which will
divide our line into three sections, and each section will be in one
piece of the circle.  So we can only split at most three of the four
pieces, giving us seven.  In a similar manner, the fourth line can
cross the other three lines only once each, dividing the fourth line
into four sections, which means that we can only split at most four
sections, leaving us eleven.  I found it not very hard to get 11
sections (draw four lines so that no three intersect at the same
point, and no two are parallel, and then draw a circle around all six
points of intersection).  There is no way to get 12.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
