The division can be

    4,8   5,7    6,6    7,5    8,4

   C(12,$0 + C(12,5) + C(12,6) + C(12,7) + C(12,8)

You don't have to count C(12,6) twice because C(12,6) is the total 
number of groups of 6 that can be formed from 12 people.  It counts 
every group of 6.

If they asked you how many WAYS could you divide 12 people into two 
groups the answer is

 (1/2).C(12,6)  

because every time you form a group of 6 you form a parallel group 
of 6, so choosing either is a WAY of dividing the 12 into two groups.

Note the distinction between the NUMBER of groups of 6

                   and the NUMBER OF WAYS of forming groups of 6
