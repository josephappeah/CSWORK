Regions of a Circle Cut by Chords to n Points
----------------------------------------------
n points are distributed round the circumference of a circle and 
each point is joined to every other point by a chord of the circle.  
Assuming that no three chords intersect at a point inside the circle 
we require the number of regions into which the circle is divided.

With no lines the circle has just one region.  Now consider any 
collection of lines.  If you draw a new line across the circle which 
does not cross any existing lines then the effect is to increase the 
number of regions by 1.  In addition, every time a new line crosses 
an existing line inside the circle the number of regions is 
increased by 1 again.

So in any such arrangement

 number of regions 

    = 1 + number of lines + number of interior intersections

                   = 1 + C(n,2) + C(n,4)

Note that the number of lines is the number of ways 2 points can be 
chosen from n points = C(n,2).  Also, the number of interior 
intersections is the number of quadrilaterals ( = C(n,4)) that can 
be formed from n points, since each quadrilateral produces just 1 
intersection where the diagonals of the quadrilateral intersect.

If we write down the first few terms of this sequence we obtain a 
pattern that appears to double the number of regions for the first 
few values of n, but this pattern breaks down at n=6

Note that n can take values 0, 2, 3, 4,....but not the value 1. 
i.e., with only one point on the circumference there will be no 
chords.

    n   =  0    2    3    4    5     6    7    8    9
Regions =  1    2    4    8    16   31   57   99   163
