Hi Corrine,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You start by rewriting the equation
in the form

   ax^2 + bx + c = 0 .

It sounds as if you know how to solve this equation.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
