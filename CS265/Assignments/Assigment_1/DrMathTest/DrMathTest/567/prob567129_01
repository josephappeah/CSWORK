Hi Brainy,

What you know is that

  something * 0.75 = 35.88

right?  (If you take 25% of the price away, you're left with 75%.)  

Here's something to think about:  Suppose I tell you that

  something * 3 = 12

How would you find the missing value?  It's really the same as your
problem, with different numbers. 

Does this help?
