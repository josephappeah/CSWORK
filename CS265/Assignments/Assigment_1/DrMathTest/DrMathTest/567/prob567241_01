Hi, Taylee --

Here are some links to pages in the Dr. Math FAQs where you can find 
some basic information which can help you with this problem.  Here 
is the link to the basic section on probability: 

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.prob.intro.html

You are interested in this particular problem in the numbers of ways 
of getting 4 out of 8 heads, 5 out of 8 heads, and so on; an 
introduction to this topic is found in the section on permutations 
and combinations:

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.comb.perm.html

In the case of flipping a coin, where there are exactly two equally 
likely outcomes, Pascal's triangle is very useful:

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.pascal.triangle.html

I will give a very brief description of the process for finding the 
answer to your problem; consult the referenced pages in the FAQs if 
you have any questions about my presentation.  (But then of course 
write back if you still have any questions about any of the solution 
process.)

For flipping a coin 8 times, you want to work with the 8th row of 
Pascal's triangle (the one beginning "1, 8, ...").  This row is

  1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1

These numbers are, respectively, the numbers of ways of getting 8, 
7, 6, ..., 1, or 0 heads on 8 flips of a coin.  Note that the sum of 
the numbers in the 8th row is 2^8=256, as it must be.

This row of Pascal's triangle tells us that there is a

   1/256 probability of getting 8 heads
   8/256 probability of getting 7 heads
  28/256 probability of getting 6 heads
  56/256 probability of getting 5 heads
  70/256 probability of getting 4 heads

So the probability of getting at least 4 heads is

  (70+56+28+8+1)/256 = 163/256

Again I invite you to write back if you can't find the answer in the 
referenced pages in the Dr. Math FAQs to any questions you have 
about this solution process.
