Hi Peter,

Thanks for writing to Doctor Math.

On a z chart, 4% in the right tail corresponds to a value of 1.75. 
In other words, you need to have a standard deviation such that 
77,000 is 1.75 standard deviations above the mean of 56,000.

As an equation we write it this way.

                77,000 - 56,000
                --------------- = 1.75
                    std_dev


Now solve for std_dev.

Does that make sense? Write again if you need more help.
