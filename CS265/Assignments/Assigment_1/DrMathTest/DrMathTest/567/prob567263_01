Hi, Cameron --

A generally more useful form of the general equation for a parabola 
is

  y-k = a(x-h)^2  [opens up or down]

or

  x-h = a(y-k)^2  [opens right or left]

In these forms, the vertex ("turning point") is (h,k) and the "a" 
determines how "thin" or "fat" the parabola is.

In your example, where the vertex is (0,0), things simplify quite 
nicely; the equation becomes simply

  y = ax^2

We can easily use the given point to determine the value of a:

  18 = a(-3)^2
  18 = 9a
  a = 2

And so the equation we are looking for is

  y = 2x^2

Or, in the form you requested,

  y = 2x^2 + 0x + 0

While your example simplifies nicely, the general case is not much 
harder to work out if you are given the vertex.  Suppose we had the 
point (3,1) and the vertex (2,-1).  Then, using our "more useful" 
form of the general equation, we have

  y-(-1) = a(x-2)^2
  y+1 = a(x-2)^2

Using our given point to determine the value of a, we find

  1+1 = a(3-2)^2
  2 = a

So our equation is

  y+1 = 2(x-2)^2

Putting this equation in the desired form, we have

  y+1 = 2(x^2-4x+4)
  y+1 = 2x^2-8x+8
  y = 2x^2-8x+7

Note that in both examples I have assumed that the parabola opens up 
or down rather than right or left.  In each example, there is 
another parabola which opens right or left which has the same vertex 
and contains the same point.  For each of these examples, you can 
find that second parabola by using the second form shown for the 
general equation.

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
