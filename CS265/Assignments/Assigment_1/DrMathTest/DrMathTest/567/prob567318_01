Hi Kris,

There are a couple of ways you might approach this.  By analogy, let's
look at the problem

  9 - 3 = ?

One thing we can do is replace 9 by 5+4, giving us

  (5+4) - 3 = ?

  5 + 4 - 3 = ?

  5 + (4-3) = ?

      5 + 1 = 6

In the same way, you could do this:

      4 - 2/8 = ?

  (3+1) - 2/8 = ?

  3 + 1 - 2/8 = ?

  3 + (1-2/8) = ?

      3 + 6/8 = 0

        3 6/8 = 0

So it's sort of like asking, "What's 4 dollars minus a quarter?" 
That's 3 dollars, plus 4 quarters minus 1 quarter, or 3 dollars and 1
quarter.  Does that make sense?

A second way to approach is is to convert the whole number into a
fraction with the same denominator.  For example, 

  4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

    = 8/8 + 8/8 + 8/8 + 8/8

    = (8+8+8+8)/8

    = (4 * 8)/8

    = 32/8

So

   4 - 2/8 = 32/8 - 2/8

           = (32 - 2)/8

           = 30/8

Which you may or may not want to convert back to a mixed number. 

Does this help?
