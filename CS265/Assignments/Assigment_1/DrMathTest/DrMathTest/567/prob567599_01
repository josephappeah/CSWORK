Hi Tom,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  That's not the rule I noticed, but it
follows from the one I noticed.  It works, so it's a place to start.  So:

We start with 60.
If our input > 1, then we multiply by 1/2.
If our input > 2, then we multiply by 2/3.
If our input > 3, then we multiply by 3/4.
And we keep going up until we multiply by (input-1)/input.

So let's look at the product:

       1   2   3   4         input-1
  60 * - * - * - * - * ... * -------
       2   3   4   5          input

Can you simplify this product at all?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
