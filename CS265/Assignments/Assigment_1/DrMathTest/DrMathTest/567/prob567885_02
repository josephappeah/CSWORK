Hi, Jason --

I see Doctor Anthony has already written a response to your 
question....

I have a different approach to this type of problem.  Different 
methods sometimes work for different students, so see if perhaps you 
like this alternative method better.  (I will not be offended if you 
prefer his method...!!)

I solve this problem using ratios.  With the candle burning from 
both ends ate constant speeds, the ratio of the lengths of candle 
burned will be the same as the ratio of those speeds.

The ratio of the two speeds is

  1.5:2.1 = 15:21 = 5:7

So the lengths burned from the two ends are also in the ratio 5:7; 
call the lengths 5x and 7x.  Then the candle is 12 inches long, so 
we have

  5x+7x = 12
  12x = 12
  x=1

Then

  5x = 5
  7x = 7

The candle burns more slowly from the top than from the bottom, so 
the distance from the top where the flames meet is the 5x=5 -- so 
the flames meet 5 inches from the top of the candle.
