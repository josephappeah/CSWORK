Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Jennifer!

You don't have enough information to find the area of the ellipse.
The best you can do is to give a bound.  The ellipse with the
greatest area with perimeter 1000m is a circle.  Its radius would
be given by 500/Pi m, and its area by 500^2/Pi m^2.  This is the
upper bound, which can be achieved.  The lower bound is zero, which
can't be achieved.  Thus the best you can say is that the area A
satisfies

   0 < A <= 250000/Pi m^2.

All values in this interval can happen.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
