Hi Lori,

Yeah, it's a potentially confusing example, but it does make the point
that  zeros at the end of a number _are_ significant, i.e., if I tell
you something is 13.0 grams, that's different than telling you it's
13.000 grams.  

So maybe they saw an opportunity for that to provide discussion in the
classroom.
