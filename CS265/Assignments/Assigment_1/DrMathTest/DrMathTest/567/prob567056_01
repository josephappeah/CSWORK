Hi Cayce,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

>understand what the question is asking us

That is simple.  It is asking for all the values of x between 0
and 2pi which satisfy the equation.  To determine that, you usually
need to rewrite the equation to reduce the question to solving an
equation involving a single trigonometric function.

>we know that cos2x = 2sinxcosx

You are confusing the Double Angle formulas for sin and cos.

   sin(2x) = 2 sin(x)cos(x), 

but

   cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)
           = 2cos^2(x) - 1
           = 1 - 2sin^2(x)  .

Using one of these identities, you can write cos(2x) in terms of
sin(x), and have a quadratic equation in sin(x).  That is, if you 
let y = sin(x), you will have a quadratic equation for y, which
you should know how to solve.  For each root r of this quadratic
equation, you then have to solve

   sin(x) = r.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
