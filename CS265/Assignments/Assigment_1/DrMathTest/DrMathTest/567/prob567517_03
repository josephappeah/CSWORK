Hi Tryna,

If you've gone through your math book, the next step is to get the
next year's book, and go through that.  Then get the book for the year
after that, and just keep going.  

You don't need a tutor to read the book to you.  You just need a tutor
when you come across something you don't understand.  When that
happens, you can write to us about that particular thing.
