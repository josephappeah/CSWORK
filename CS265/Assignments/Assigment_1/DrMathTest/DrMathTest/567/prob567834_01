Hi Phyliss,

That's kind of like asking "What are the four families of
automobiles?"  The answer is completely arbitrary, and I'm just asking
you to guess what I'm thinking.  Maybe I'm thinking the four
'families' are station wagons, red cars, convertibles, and everything
else.  

That's how this question is.  Technology isn't broken into four
'families', or eight, or twenty-nine.  Your teacher, or the author of
a book, might make up some scheme that he likes; but that doesn't mean
that anyone else knows about it, or that anyone should care.
