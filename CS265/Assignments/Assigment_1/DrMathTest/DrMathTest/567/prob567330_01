Hi Suzy,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You need the volume

  5000 yard^2 * 4 inches
    = 5000 (3 ft)^2 * (1/3) ft
    = 5000 * 3^2 * (1/3) ft^3
    = 15,000 cubic feet

of topsoil.  Do they sell it in cubic feet?  If you need a different
unit of volume, then change it at

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
