Hi, Jake --

I don't know the exact answer you are supposed to come up with....

But the estimate is a bad one.  If you want to get a good estimate 
in a multiplication problem, you need to round one of the numbers up 
and the other one down.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about this.
