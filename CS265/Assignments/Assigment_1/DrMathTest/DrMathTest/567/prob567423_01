Hi, Cynthia --

If you spend half of your TIME at 48km per hour and half of your 
TIME at 132 km per hour, then you will average 90 km per hour.  But 
if you travel half of the DISTANCE at 48km per hour and want to 
average 90 km per hour for the whole distance, then you have used up 
most of the available time at the lower speed, so you have to go a 
lot faster over the remaining distance.

Mathematically, probably the easiest way to solve this problem is to 
pick a convenient distance.  Since you want to average 90km per hour 
over two halves of the trip, it might be convenient to choose a 
distance of 180km.

So suppose the distance is 180km; to average 90km per hour, you need 
to make the trip is 2 hours.  For the first 90km, you average only 
48km per hour; the time it takes for that part of the trip is

  90/48 = 15/8 = 1 7/8 hours

You only have 1/8 of an hour left to cover the remaining 90km; to do 
that, your average speed has to be

  90/(1/8) = 720km per hour

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
