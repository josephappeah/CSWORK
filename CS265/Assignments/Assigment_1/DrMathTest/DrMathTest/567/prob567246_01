Hi Connie,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Inches measure length.  Square inches
measure area.  They apparently price prints by area.  Multiply the
length (in inches) of your sign by the width (in inches) and that is
the number of square inches of area of your sign.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
