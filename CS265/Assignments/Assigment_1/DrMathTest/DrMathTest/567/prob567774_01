Hi Betty,

If you're starting with a decimal, you can just count up the number of
decimal places, and that tells you the denominator of the
corresponding fraction.  For example, 

                 333
  6.333   ->  6 ----
                1000        Same number of zero as decimal places

                  24
  6.024   ->  6 ----
                1000

                   129
  6.00129 ->  6 ------
                100000

Once you have it as a mixed number, you this

  Converting Mixed Numbers to/from Improper Fractions
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58876.html

will tell you how to change it to an improper fraction, if that's what
you want to do. 

Does this help?
