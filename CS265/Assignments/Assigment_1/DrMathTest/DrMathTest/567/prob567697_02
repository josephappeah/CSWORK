I could tell you if I knew what you mean by "at the round dimension 
(center of the wood." Is 60 cm the diameter (the distance across, 
going through the center), or the circumference (the distance around 
the outside), or the radius (distance from the center to the outside)?

I am assuming that the wood is a cylinder, like a round pole. The 
formula for the volume of a cylinder is

  V = pi*h*r^2

where pi is the number 3.1416 (approximately), h is the length (8 
metres in your example), and r is the radius (half the diameter). If 
the diameter is 60 cm then the radius is 30 cm, so

  h = 8 m
  r = 30 cm = 0.3 m
  V = 3.1416 * 8 m * 0.3 m * 0.3 m
    = 2.262 cubic metres

If you want to find the length that will give a volume of 1 cubic 
metre, the volume is proportional to the length so all you have to do 
is divide the length of this piece by 2.262 to get a volume of 1 
cubic metre:

  8 m / 2.262 = 3.537 metres

If this isn't enough information to answer your questions, please try 
again to explain what you know and what you want to find out.
