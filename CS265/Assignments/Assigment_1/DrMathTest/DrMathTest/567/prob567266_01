I can't understand the question well enough to be sure I'm answering 
it. Could you write it out in numerals and symbols? Perhaps you mean 
this?

  4    2
  - * -- = ?
  5   15

I use "*" for the multiplication sign because "x" has another meaning 
(a variable, which you may have seen by now).

If this is the problem, there is no simplification to do beyond 
multiplying the numerators and multiplying the denominators -- which 
is how you multiply fractions. The numerator is 4*2 = 8, and the 
denominator is 5*15 = 75, so the answer is 8/75.

Sometimes you can make the answer simpler -- you can reduce it to 
lowest terms, which means finding an equivalent fraction that has the 
smallest numbers possible. Here is such an example:

  4    3
  - * -- = ?
  9   10

When I multiply the numerators and the denominators, I get 12/90, but 
this is not in lowest terms: both 12 and 90 are divisible by 6. 
Dividing both numbers by 6, I get the equivalent fraction 2/15, which 
is the answer in lowest terms -- I have simplified it as much as I 
can.
