Hello Kevin,

I don't know if you mean (e^(x)+1)/(e^(-x)-1)  or (e^(x)+1)(e^(-x)-1), but, in any case, 
neither of these expressions simplifies to  -e^(x)+e^(-x)-1 .

I'll assume that you mean (e^(x)+1)/(e^(-x)-1).

Let's suppose for the moment that x>0.  As x approaches 0, the numerator approaches 2 
and the denominator approaches 0 from the negative side.  So, the graph has x=0 as an 
asymptote.  As x becomes large, the numerator becomes large and the denomiator 
approaches -1.  So the fraction is approaching -oo.  So, without trying to nail down 
exactly what happens in between, it appears that the graph increases from -oo near x=0 
to some maximum and then falls away and again approaches -oo.  It stays negative 
because the numerator is always positive and for x>0,  1/(e^{-x}-1) < 0.  One cannot be 
certain that an extra wiggle or two doesn't happen somewhere to the rigth of the origin, 
but the simple behavior of e^x or e^{-x} argues against this.

For x<0,  0 < e^x < 1 and e^{-x} - 1 >0.  Hence, the graph will be above the x-axis for all 
x<0.  As x approaches 0 from the left, e^{-x} approaches 1 and so the graph again has 
x=0 as an asymptote.  As x-> - oo, the expression approaches 0.  So, though there may 
be a wiggle inbetween (most likely not because e^x is simple increasing function), the 
graph looks much like -1/x for x<0.

One can use calculus to find the relative high and low points, though one might need a 
numerical procedure to locate them.  For example, for x>0, the top of the hill is at 
x=ln(1+sqrt(2)).
