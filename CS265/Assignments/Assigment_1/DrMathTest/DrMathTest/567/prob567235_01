Hi Michelle,

Is it the negative, or the multiplication, that you're having trouble
with?  Suppose we just had

  13(7) + 12

This is the same as

  13 x 7 + 12

so we do the multiplication first (using PEMDAS), and then the addition:

  13 x 7 + 12 = 91 + 12 = 103

So 

  13(-7) + 12

is just an extension of that.  Again, we do the multiplication first,

  13 x -7 + 12 = -91 + 12

and then you do the addition. 

Does this help?
