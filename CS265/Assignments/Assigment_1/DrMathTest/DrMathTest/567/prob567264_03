Hi Kevin,

For any positive number c, there is a curve in the first quadrant

   sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) = c.

For example, we can take c=1 and look at

   sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) = 1 ,

or take c = 100 and consider

   sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) = 100 ,

and so on.

No matter what value of c is chosen, if we pick a specific point on
the curve, which I called (x0,y0), compute the tangent line to 
the curve at this point, find the intercepts of this tangent and add
them, we will get a number.  If we pick a second point, (x1,y1) on
this same curve, compute the tangent line, and add its intercepts, we
will get the same number that we got for (x0,y0).  If we pick a 
different value of c, we get a different curve and a different number
for the sum of the intercepts, but we will get the same number for the
sum of the intercepts for all points on this second curve.

For example, if we choose c= 7, then (9,16) is a point on the curve

  sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) = 7 ,

since

   sqrt(9) + sqrt(16) = 3 + 4 = 7.

If we compute the tangent line to the curve at (9,16) and add the 
two intercepts, then we will get the same number that we get if 
we compute the tangent to the curve

     sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) = 7

at the point (16,9) (which is another point on the curve) and add the
intercepts.

If the "c" bothers you, use a specific value of c, such as 7, and
verify the statements I just made.

Can you compute the tangent line to

     sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) = 7

at (9,16) and at (16,9)?
