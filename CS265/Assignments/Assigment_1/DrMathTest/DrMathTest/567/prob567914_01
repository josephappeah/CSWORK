Hi Sam,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  That's exactly right.

  Specific gravity = 1.0

means that you should assume that the density is exactly that of
water, which is approximately 8.34 lbs per gallon.  You see, you can't
convert volume (gallons) into weight (pounds) without knowing the
density.  The specific gravity is just a measurement of density, where

  density = weight / volume,

and

  specific gravity = density / (density of water).

And the density of water is exactly

  1 gram / milliliter

or approximately

  8.34540445201933 pounds / gallon.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
