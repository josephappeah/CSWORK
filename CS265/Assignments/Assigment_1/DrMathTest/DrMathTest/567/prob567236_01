A little Latin will help: the word percent comes from the Latin 
for "for each hundred" (as century means 100 years and a cent is 
1/100 of a dollar). Thus 4% is the same as 4 hundredths. Now I've 
already got the percent as a fraction, just by translating the Latin 
word! However, 4/100 isn't in lowest terms: both 4 and 100 are 
divisible by 4, so I divide each by 4 to get the equivalent fraction 
1/25 in lowest terms.

What's nice about hundredths is that they are so easy to write as 
decimals. To divide a number by 100, you just move the decimal point 
two places to the left. You know that a whole number has a "phantom 
decimal point" just to the right of the units digit: 4 = 4. so moving 
the decimal point two places to the left looks like this:

      4.
     .4
   .0 4

I added the zero as a place-holder. Thus 4% = 4/100 = 0.04.

Can you work out the other two? If you aren't sure, show me what you 
think you should do, and I'll let you know how you are doing.
