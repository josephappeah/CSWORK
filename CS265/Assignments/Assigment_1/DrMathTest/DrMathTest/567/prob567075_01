Hi Rita,

The angle of elevation is the angle above the horizontal, e.g., 

     /
    /
   / angle of elevation
  .............

The angle of depression is the angle below the horizontal, e.g., 

   ............
   \ angle of depression
    \
     \

You could also say that the angle of depression is the angle of
elevation, with a negative value; but some people find that confusing.  

In this problem, you have a hill, with a pole on top of it:

        .
     .     .
  .           .

The angle of depression of the hill is 21 degrees, 

        T
        |
        |
        |
        B..................H        HBC = 21 degrees
     .     .
  A           C

The angle of depression of the shadow is 48 degrees:

        T..................H'       H'TC = 48 degrees
        |
        |
        |
        B..................H        HBC = 21 degrees
     .     .
  A           C


You're given the length of BC (55 m), and you're asked to find the
length of TB.  

So far, all I've done is a pretty literal translation of the problem,
which is the first step in solving most problems like this.  Before
going on, can you tell me if you were able to follow this okay, and
whether you think you'd be able to make a similar drawing for another
problem?

Hi,

Take a look at


and write back if it's not clear, or if you still have questions. 

Or have I misunderstood your question? 
Is this enough to get started? 
Can you take it from here? 
Does this help?
