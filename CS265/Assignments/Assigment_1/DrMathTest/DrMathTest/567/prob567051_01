Hi Manisha,

Actually, this isn't an assignment, it's an assertion.  An assignment
is when you decide to substitute -5 for x, to get

  -5 = -5

which is a true statement.  The statement 

  -5 = x

may or may not be true, depending on what value you assign to x. 

So in fact, this _is_ an open sentence, even though it's not a very
_interesting_ one. 

Does this help?
