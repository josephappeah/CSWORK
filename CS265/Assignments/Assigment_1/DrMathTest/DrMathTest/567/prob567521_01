Hello Russ,

Suppose we have a triangle with vertices A, B, and C and sides a, b, and c opposite these 
vertices.  You have said that a=30, b=18, and c=18.  Think about this triangle with the 
vertex A on top and the opposite side a=30 on the bottom and horizontal.

There are at least two way to approach this problem.  The easiest is to calculate the height 
directly and then use the formula area= (1/2)*height*base.

Draw a line from A to the midpoint M of side BC.  Triangle AMC is a right triangle.  AM has 
length h.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem

18^2 = h^2 + 15^2

So,

h^2=18^2-15^2 = 3*33=99.

So,

h=3*sqrt(11).

So, area = (1/2)*3*sqrt(11)*30 = 45*sqrt(11) = 149.248, approximately.

The other way is to use Heron's Formula.  

Let s = (a+b+c)/2
 
Then the area is 

K = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]
