Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Xaley!

Substitute y = 2*x - k into the first equation.  That gives you a
quadratic equation in y whose coefficients are in terms of k.  Then
this will have two real roots if and only if the discriminant of
this quadratic is positive.  That gives you a quadratic inequality
in k.  Solve that to find the values of k that work.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
