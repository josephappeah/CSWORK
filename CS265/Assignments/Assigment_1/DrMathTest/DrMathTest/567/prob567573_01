"Counting the boxes" sounds more like finding the area than the 
perimeter. To find the perimeter, you'd want to measure lengths. For 
sides that aren't vertical or horizontal, you could place another 
piece of graph paper along the side and measure, or you could use the 
Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length as the hypotenuse of a 
right triangle whose legs are horizontal and vertical.
