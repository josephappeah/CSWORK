You require the coefficient of x^24 in the expansion of

 (1 + x^2 + x^4 + ...).(1 + x^3 + x^6 + ........)

        1       1
      ------ . ------
      (1-x^2) (1-x^3)


On expansion this gives the term 5x^24, so there will be 5 solutions 
in integers of the equation 2x+3y=24

I used Maple to give the expansion.  Without such an aid you would 
be reduced to picking out the products in above two brackets which 
give the term in x^24.  That would hardly be an improvement on 
simply counting the solutions by inspection.
