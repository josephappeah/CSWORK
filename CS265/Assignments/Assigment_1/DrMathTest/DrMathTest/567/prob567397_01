Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

You know that:

   30 = (r - 5)*t

or:

    t = 30/(r - 5)

In the second equation:

    30 = (r + 5)(t - 1)

Instead of t, you can use 30/(r-5):

    30 = (r + 5)(30/(r - 5) - 1)

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
