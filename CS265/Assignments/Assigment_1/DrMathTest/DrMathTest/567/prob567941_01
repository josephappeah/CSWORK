Hi Casey,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Sometimes it helps to break the
problem into simpler parts.  For example, note that you can 
write the given differential as

   (y+x^3+xy^2)dx - xdy = (y dx - x dy) + x(x^2+y^2) dx    .

Does this form give you any ideas?

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
