Hi NB,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Have you ever heard a logician claim "Anything can be derived from a 
contradiction"?

Let's say you have a contradiction.  What I mean by that is something 
of the form:

 1) A ^ ~A

From that you can get:

 2) A (simplification)

 3) A v B

 4) ~A -> B

 5) ~A (simplificiation of 1)

 6) B (modus ponens)

Notice how starting with a premise (line 1) which was contradictory, 
we were able to conclude B which had nothing to do with the initial 
premise.

I suspect that you need to find a contradiction in your premises.

Your work is good so far.

However, I don't personally see a way to get a contradiction from 
your premises as they are given.  Are you sure there's not another 
premise or a mis-typed letter or something?

I will leave this problem in the Dr. Math inbox where other 
volunteers can look at it in case one of them sees something I'm 
missing.
