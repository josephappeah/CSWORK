Hi, Brian --

I'm not sure where this question comes from....  If you are 
restricted to the decimals .1, .2, .3, and so on, then you can't 
convert 4 1/4 to a decimal correctly.

Think of this problem in terms of dollars and cents.  4 1/4 dollars 
is four dollars and a quarter, which you know is $4.25.  So the 
decimal equivalent of 4 1/4 is 4.25.  But that is halfway between 
4.2 and 4.3 -- so you are stuck.  If all you need is the "closest 
approximation", then you can choose either 4.2 or 4.3.
