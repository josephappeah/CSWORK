Hi Tim,

Do you mean you want to describe it?  It's the line connecting
opposite corners.  

Or do you mean you want to compute the length of it, given the edge
length of the cube?  To do that, you need to apply the Pythagorean
Theorem twice...  

      E----F
     /|   /|
    A----B |
    | H--| G
    |/   |/
    D----C

For example, suppose you know the length AD. Then you also know the
lengths DC and CG.  So you can use Pythagoras to find the diagonal DG.

So then you know AD and DG.  Which means you can use Pythagoras again
to find the length AG, which is the longest line in the cube...

Does this help?
