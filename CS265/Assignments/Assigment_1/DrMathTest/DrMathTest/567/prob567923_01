I can see how phrases like this can be confusing; you don't quite talk
like this in real life. Let's think about examples where you might say
something close.

Suppose I had written a paper with 13 pages, and my teacher said it
was too long -- the number of pages should be 5 less than that. How
many pages should it have? Well, 5 less than 13 is 8; I subtract 5
from 13.

To get 5 less than any number, what do you do?

Suppose we call that number N. Then what expression indicates 5 less
than the number N?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back and show me
what you've got.
