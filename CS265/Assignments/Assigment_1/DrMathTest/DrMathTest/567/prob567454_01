Hello Rita,

The circumference of a the circle made by a blade with radius 50 ft (I have assumed that a 
100-foot blade refers to the diameter) is 2*pi*50.  So in 1 minute, 40*2*pi*50 ft will have 
passed a fixed point on the circumference.  So, the linear speed is 4000*pi.

You can also think about this in terms of the s=r*w, relationship, where s is arc length, w 
is the central angle (in radians), and r is the radius of the circle.  So, assuming you know a 
little bit of calculus (if not, please ignore)

ds/dt = r*(dw/dt).

You know dw/dt=40*2*pi and so

ds/dt = 50*40*2*pi=4000*pi.
