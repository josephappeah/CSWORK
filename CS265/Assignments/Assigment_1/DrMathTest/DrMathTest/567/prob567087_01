Hi Iris,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I'm not sure.  Different calendars
have been used throughout history, and there are still several
calendars in common use in different parts of the world today.  So
whether this is the year 2004 and not 2003 is really just a matter of
what you want to call the years, and whether today is Monday instead
of Tuesday is just a matter of what you want to call the days of the
week (and how many days there are in a week, and so on).

He might be saying:  How do we know that it was really 2003 years ago
that Jesus Christ was born, since this is the event that are calendar
is (theoretically) based on, but that sounds more like a question for
a history teacher than a math teacher.

He might be saying:  How do we determine what day of the week a
particular date falls on, and there is a formula for this, but that
doesn't quite sound like what you're saying.

He might be saying:  There is a reason for numbering the years and
days the way we do, and it might have something to do with zero being
a newer concept than the calendar we use (causing one-off problems
like the 19th century beginning with the year 1801, and so forth).

More than this, I cannot say what he might mean.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
