Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Kelly!

You are being asked to solve

   10*(y^3) = (10*y)^3.

Use the laws of exponents to expand the right-hand side.  Then
subtract 10*y^3 from both sides.  Then combine like terms on the
right-hand side.  Then figure out the values of y making the
resulting equation true.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
