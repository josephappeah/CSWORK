Hi Aditya,

If it seems to be getting too big, you can do what I did, and
substitute smaller symbols for the bigger parts.  If you have

  3x*this + 3x*that + 3x*other + stuff = whatever

you can do this:

   3x*(this + that + other) + stuff = whatever

          3x*(this + that + other) = whatever - stuff

                                        whatever - stuff
                                 x = ----------------------- 
                                     3*(this + that + other)

Then you can unto the substitution.  But at that point, the work of
solving is done, so it doesn't matter how big the thing on the right
gets, since you don't have to manipulate it.  

This is a very useful trick to know about, which will become more
useful as you continue in math.  It's hard for people to see when
simple patterns like the distributive property apply when there's lots
of random-looking stuff around.  Substitution can help you get around
that.
