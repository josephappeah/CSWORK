Hi Sadia,

Note that when we write 

  3s

we mean

  3 times s

So you can make things clearer by including the multiplication symbol
explicitly:

  3*s + 2*(8 - s) = 3

If you apply the distributive property to the second term on the left,
you get

  2*(8 - s) = (2*8 - 2*s)

which means the original equation can be written

  3*s + 2*8 - 2*s = 3

Does this help?
