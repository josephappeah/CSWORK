Hi Matthew,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

>     2) both f_x(x,y) and f_y(x,y) is continuous at p

(1) is true, since that is exactly what Theorem B says.  (2) is not
true.  The continuity of the partial derivatives f_x and f_y is a 
sufficient condition for differentiability (which is what Theorem A 
says), but it is not a necessary condition (just as in one dimension,
where a function can have a derivative at every point, but the 
derivative need not be a continuous function).

In fact, the one-dimensional counterexample works here:

  f(x,y) = {(x^2+y^2)sin(1/sqrt(x^2+y^2)) for (x,y) =/= (0,0),
           {            0                     (x,y) = (0,0)     .

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
