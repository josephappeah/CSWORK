Hi Mathew,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Solve for y in one of the equations,
and substitute into the other.

Or solve both equations for y and set them equal to one another.

Either way, you get an equation in x, which you can solve using the
quadratic formula or by factoring.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
