Hi, Porsha --

The instructions are not clear enough to know how to solve the 
problem.  After cutting the square pieces out of the two corners 
along one of the short sides of the sheet of cardboard, I can think 
of several different ways to cut rectangles out of the other two 
corners to be able to form a box with a lid; the different 
rectangles result in different types of lids for the box.

The simplest one mathematically -- but one which doesn't make much 
sense practically -- is where the lid has exactly the same 
dimensions as the "floor" of the box; i.e., the "lid" doesn't 
overlap the sides of the box at all.

In that case, we have taken "x" units out of each corner along a 20-
inch side, so that dimension of the box is going to be (20-2x) 
inches.  The depth of the box is obviously going to be x inches.  If 
the lid is to have exactly the same dimensions as the "floor", then 
the rectangles cut out must be x inches wide and 18 inches long 
(half the length of the sheet).  So the length of the box is going 
to be (18-x) inches.

Then the volume of the box is

  V = (18-x)(20-2x)(x)

The domain for this problem is the set of possible values for "x", 
the dimension of the square piece we cut off each corner.  Clearly 
this can't be a negative number, so the lower bound of our domain is 
x=0.  The short side of the piece of cardboard is 20 inches long; 
the most we can cut off each corner is 10 inches, so the upper bound 
of our domain is x=10.  So the domain for this problem is [0,10].

If you are doing calculus, you can expand the expression for the 
volume, take the derivative, and find where the derivative is equal 
to 0 to find the maximum value of the box.  Unfortunately, the 
expressions do not turn out "nice" (the derivative does not factor), 
so you end up having to solve the problem using the quadratic 
formula on the derivative.

It is much easier -- especially if you have a graphing calculator -- 
simply to graph the volume function and determine the maximum value 
from the graph.

I hope some of this helps.  Please write back if you have any 
further questions about any of this.
