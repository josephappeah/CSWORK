Hi Ashley,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Those are the x values for the two
points of intersection.  After that, you plug each of those back into
the equation of the line (which is easier to solve than the circle) to
get the corresponding y values.  Then you have two points.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
