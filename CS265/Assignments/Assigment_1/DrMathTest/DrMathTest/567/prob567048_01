Hi Shea,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  While I didn't check your
calculations, you should notice that

  2(sinx)(cosx)+(cosx)(1-4(sinx)^2)

and

  (cosx)(2sinx+(1-2sinx)(1+2sinx))

are both expressions that involve only sinx and cosx.  So I think
you're done.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
