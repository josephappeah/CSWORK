Is this the same problem as the first one I answered, except for the 
numbers? Now you've made clear that the 50 cm is the circumference 
(the word we use for the perimeter of a circle) of the cylindrical 
shape. From the circumference we can find the radius, using the 
formula for the circumference

  Circumference = 2*pi*Radius

and solving it for the radius:

  Radius = Circumference / (2*pi)

If the circumference is 50 cm, the radius is

  Radius = 50 cm / (2 * 3.1416)
         = 7.96 cm

Then you can go back to the formula I showed you before:

    Volume = pi * Height * Radius^2

to calculate the volume.

I don't know what you mean by "how much is 1 cubic metre exactly?" Do 
you mean what the length should be in order to make the volume 1 m^3, 
if the radius remains 7.96 cm? We can solve the volume formula to get 
a formula for the height when we know the volume and the radius:

  Height = Volume / (pi * Radius^2)

Use this formula with Volume = 1 m^3 and Radius = 7.96 cm = 0.0796 m 
to find the height (length) of the cylinder.
