Hi Geraldine,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  This kind of problem is called a
"cryptarithm."  The usual rules are that each letter stands for a
different digit.  There are web sites that solve them automatically,
such as

  http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/llp/crypt.html

where you type in

  four+seven=eleven

and it finds all of the solutions.  In fact, it will tell you
immediately that there are no solutions.

Now how would you have checked that by hand?  Well, first of all you
decided that the S has to be a 9 if the answer is going to have one
more digit that each operand.  Also, there will need to be a carry
into that (the fifth) column, so that 9 + carry will give two digits,
and then the biggest number it could give is 10, which means

  S = 9
  E = 1
  L = 0.

Now we have

     FOUR
   +91V1N
   ------
   101V1N

Now if we add F to 1 and get 1 plus a carry, that means that we have
to get 11.  But even F can't be bigger than 9, and it can't equal 9
since S is 9, so F can't be bigger than 8.  But then even if we have a
carry into that column too, the most we could get is 8 + 1 + carry =
10, which is still too small.  So there is no way to solve this.

There is a different way to do this, too, by starting on the right. 
Look at the ones column, and suppose that

  R + N = N,

or, if there is a carry out of that column, then

  R + N = 10 + N.

So what does R have to be?  Now look at the last two columns:

  (10*U + R) + (10*E + N) = 10*E + N

or, if there is a carry out of the second column, then

  (10*U + R) + (10*E + N) = (10*E + N) + 100.

You already found R.  Solve for U.  But that's the same thing that R
is!  So you have a repeat again!  So there are no solutions.

In fact, even if you allow repeats, you also have to allow for the
leftmost digit E to be zero, and still the only solutions are

  F = O = U = R = E = 0,
  S = L,
  L, V, and N can be anything.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
