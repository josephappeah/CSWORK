Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

This is actually a re-wording of the Goldbach conjecture: Every even
number greater than 2 can be expressed as a sum of two primes.

Notice that if n+a and n-a are primes (presumably odd primes, since 2
is the only even prime), then:

   n+a + n-a = 2*n

2*n is the generic form for any even number, and it is the sum of two
prime numbers. So, your conjecture is really the Goldbach conjecture
expressed slightly differently. 

Hope this helps.
