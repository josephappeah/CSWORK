Hello, Paola --

The given x-values are equally spaced; however, the y-values are 
not.  Therefore, we do not have a line.  Without any more 
information, we can't answer most of the specific questions, because 
many different functions could have the given (x,y) values.

>what is the slope of the line?

We don't have a line, so we don't have a slope.  The graph might be 
several straight line segments, each with a constant slope; or it 
might be a smooth curve, with a slope which is constantly changing.

>what is the value of y when x=3?

This one is given to us; when x=3, y=19.

>what is the value when x=7?
>what is the value when y=0?

We can't tell.  Many different functions can have the given set of 
(x,y) values; those different functions will most likely have 
different y-values when x=7, and they will most likely have 
different x-values when y=0.
