That's sort of the point of the proof, isn't it?  That trying to
evaluate it requires you to evaluate an expression that isn't defined.

It's sort of like trying to answer:

  if   f(x) = x/(x-2) 
  then f(2) = ?

Trying to evaluate it leads you to division by zero, so f(2) has no
value.  

Similarly, trying to evaluate 0^i leads you to taking the logarithm of
zero, so 0^i has no value.

First, what was the purpose of restricting a so that it's not equal to
zero or one?
