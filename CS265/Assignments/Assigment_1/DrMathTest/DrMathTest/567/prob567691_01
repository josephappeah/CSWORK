Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Diep!

Obviously + above does not denote addition, but some other operation
combining the two numbers on the left to get the number on the right.
I tried a few things, then thought of computing this:

   5 - 2^2,
   13 - 3^2,
   41 - 5^2,
   61 - 6^2.

Then I saw a pattern, and so should you.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
