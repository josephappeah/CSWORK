Hi, Jenn --

You're doing fine....

I would multiply the whole equation through by 100 to get rid of the 
decimals -- they just confuse things.  Then we would have

  .05x + 2.5 = 3/2 (5 - .05x)
  5x + 250 = 3/2 ( 500 - 5x)
  5x + 250 = 750 - 7.5x
  12.5x = 500
  x = 40

There are 40 nickels and 10 dimes.

Checking this result...

40 nickels, 10 dimes:  40(5) + 10(10) = 200+100 = 300 (cents)
10 nickels, 40 dimes:  10(5) + 40(10) = 50+400 = 450 (cents)

And it is true that 450 is 3/2 (300), so our answer is correct.

I have an editorial comment regarding this problem.  The title of 
your message is "Humber Series Math unit #10"; I assume that is the 
name of a published textbook of some sort.  If so, and if you have 
quoted the problem correctly, then the problem has no solution.

In your work, you have shown the total with the dimes and nickels 
switched being 3/2 as big as the actual total.  "3/2 as big" 
means "half again as big", or "1/2 times greater".  The problem as 
you quote it says the total with the dimes and nickels switched 
is "3/2 times greater"; this means the same as "5/2 times as big" -- 
and when you try working the problem with "5/2" instead of "3/2", 
the number of dimes comes out negative.

If in fact this problem is correctly quoted out of a published text, 
then you should do a public service by writing the publisher and 
requesting that correct grammar be used when presenting problems 
from which students are supposed to be learning.
