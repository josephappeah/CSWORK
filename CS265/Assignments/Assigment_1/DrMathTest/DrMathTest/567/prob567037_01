Hi Melina,

The point of working out problems is not to find the answers, but to
get practice.  So if I tell you an answer in hopes that you'll learn
from that, isn't that sort of like my eating your breakfast, hoping
that it will make you stronger?  Or my running 5 miles every morning
hoping that it will get you in better physical condition?
