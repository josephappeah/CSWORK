Hi Mike,

I only found one question in all of that, so I'll answer that:

Yes, there is a systematic treatment of this subject, and it is called
Galois Theory of finite fields.  It is exactly the same subject you
are studying.  All of the same theorems apply.  It's just that instead
of polynomials over GF(2), you have polynomials over GF(q) for some
other prime power q.
