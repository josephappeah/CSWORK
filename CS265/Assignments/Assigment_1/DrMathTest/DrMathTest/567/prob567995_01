Hello Kevin,

Well, there's a vertical asymptote at x=0. To find the horizonal asymptotedivide by e^x:

f(x) = [1+1/e^x]/[1-1/e^x]

and we see that as x->oo, f(x)->1.  As x->-oo, we see from the original form of f(x) that 
f(x)->-1.

Other than those comments, your observation that it looks like y=1/x pretty much finishes 
the observations you need.
