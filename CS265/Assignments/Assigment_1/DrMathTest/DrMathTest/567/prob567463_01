Hello Ed,

If in a right triangle (these are the triangles with one side called the "hypotenuse") you kow 
the length of the hypotenuse, you cannot calculate the remaining two sides because there 
are infinitely many right triangles with the same hypotenuse.

If the  hypotenuse is 5, then the sides might be 3 and 4 because 3^2+4^2=5^2.  On the 
other hand, if one of the sides is 1, then the other will be 

1^2+b^2=5^2=25

so

b^2 = 25-1=24

and so b=sqrt(24).
