Hi, Pamela --

I don't understand several aspects of your question.  The problem 
appears to be given in hexadecimal, so there is no need to convert 
it to hexadecimal.

I can't tell if you are looking for help for general problems like 
this or for this specific one.  It is easy to find the decimal 
answer for this particular example....

In base 10, we have

  9 = 10^1 - 1
  99 = 10^2 - 1
  999 = 10^3 - 1
  ...
  etc., etc.

Similarly, in base 16, we have

  F = 16^1 - 1
  FF = 16^2 - 1
  FFF = 16^3 - 1
  ...
  etc., etc.

So in your problem, each "FFFFF" is simply 16^5 - 1; and there are 6 
of them added together.  The calculator on my PC shows this sum to 
be 6291450.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
