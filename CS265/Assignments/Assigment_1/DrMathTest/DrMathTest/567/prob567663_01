Hello Shirley,

I imagine they are thinking about a loan of, say, 30 years, with a fixed percentage and a 
fixed monthly payment.  The fixed monthly payment divided by your (increasing) salary 
will decrease.  I think that's the point.

The fact remains, however, that even with inflation, one pays a lot of interest for a 30 year 
loan.
