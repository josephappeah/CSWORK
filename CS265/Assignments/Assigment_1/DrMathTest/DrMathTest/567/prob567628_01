Hi Cassie,

Start from the definition of perimeter.  If you know the lengths of
the sides of the rectangle, you can just add them up to get the
perimeter, right?  

Suppose we label the points of the rectangle A, B, C, and D.  There
are lots of ways to pair these up:  

  AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD

and each of these pairs defines a line segment. Four of those line
segments will be sides of the rectangle; the other two will be
diagonals.  So your first job is to find out which are which!  You can
do that by plotting the four points and observing how they're arranged
with respect to each other. 

So now, suppose you've decided that the segments AB, BC, CD, and AD
are the sides of the rectangle.  To find the length of a side, you
need to find the distance between the endpoints.  For example, to find
the length of AB, you have to find the distance between point A and
point B.  To do that, you can use the Pythagorean theorem:

       B
      /.
     / . difference in y    AB^2 = (diff in x)^2 + (diff in y)^2
    /  .
   A....
     difference
     in x

Does this make sense?
