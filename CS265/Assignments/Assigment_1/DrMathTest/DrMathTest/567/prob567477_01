The formula you suggest must come from some context in which the 
length and width were in yards. If the length and width of a 
rectangle are given in feet, and you simply multiply them together, 
you get the area of the rectangle in square feet. If the length and 
width are given in yards, multiplying them gives you the area in 
square yards.

The floor area of your room, for instance, is

  16 feet * 18 feet = 288 square feet
