Hi Eric,

The square inscribed in the ellipse

     (x/a)^2  + (y/b)^2 = 1

has all of its vertices on the ellipse.  We can assume that the sides of the square are 
parallel and/or perpendicular to the axes, and so the coordinates of the vertices are 
located at

     (s,s), (s,-s), (-s,-s), (-s,s),

where s is half the length of a side.  It is clear that if any one of these four points satisfies 
the equation of the ellipse (and therefore, lies on the ellipse), then the other three do as 
well.  Substituting, we find that s must satisfy

     (s/a)^2 + (s/b)^2 = 1,

or

     s^2 = (ab)^2/(a^2 + b^2).

Since the area of the square is 4s^2, the answer is simply

     4(ab)^2/(a^2 + b^2).
