Hi Tarnae,

Actually, 6 times 12 is 72.  But you've got the right idea.  

>1 Ah-il equal 18 inches, so how many Ah-ils would 6ft and 6inches

If an 'ah' is 18 inches, that's the same as 1.5 feet, and four of
those would fit into 6 feet.  So 

  6 ft 6 in = 4 ahs + 6 inches

And 6 inches is 1/3 of an ah, so 

  6 ft 6 in = 4 1/3 ahs

Does this help?
