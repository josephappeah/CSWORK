Hi, Derek --

(6!)/6 = 120; or some people prefer to think of it as just 5! = 120.

If the 6 chairs were in a straight line, the number of arrangements 
would be 6!=720 -- there are 6 choices for the first chair; for each 
of those 6 choices, 5 choices for the second chair, giving a total 
of 6*5 choices; for each of those 6*5 choices, 4 choices for the 
third chair,... and so on.

When the chairs are arranged around a table, the interpretation I 
favor is that there are still the same 6!=720 arrangements; however, 
since you can no longer tell where the "beginning" of the "line" is, 
each distinct arrangement around the table could be any one of 6 
different arrangements in a line, so the number of arrangements 720 
is too big by a factor 0f 6 -- i.e., the number of arrangements 
around the table is (6!)/6 = 720/6 = 120.

Some people prefer to think of this problem as having to arbitrarily 
seat one person to establish the "starting point" of the "line"; 
after that person is seated, there are 5! ways to seat the remaining 
5 people in that "line".

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
