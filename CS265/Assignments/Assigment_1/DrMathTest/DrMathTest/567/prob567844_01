Hi Tony,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It doesn't matter how you pick which 
side is which, so long as the angle with the same letter is the one 
OPPOSITE the side with that letter.  So side c is the side OPPOSITE 
the 90-degree angle.  Then you can pick a and b to be either of the 
other two sides.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write 
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to 
offer further suggestions.
