Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The number 12 is even, but it has an
odd digit in it.  If you want the SMALLEST even number that has all of
those digits, then you need an even number in the last place, and you
want the smallest possible numbers in the furthest-left digits.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
