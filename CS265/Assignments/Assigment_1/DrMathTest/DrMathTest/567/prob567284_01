Hi Taryn,

I'm not quite sure what you are asking, but I'm pretty certain it has
to do with arithmetic progressions, so you might want to search for
the phrase

  "arithmetic progression"

through our archives, at

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/mathgrepform.html

I hope this helps.  If you'd like to talk about this some more, or if
you have any other questions, feel free to write back, and please
explain, for example, how you got 149 from 50, and what you got for b
and c.  And what are those two lists of numbers at the top?
