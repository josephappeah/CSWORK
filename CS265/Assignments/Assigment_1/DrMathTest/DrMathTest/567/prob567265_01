Hi Nicholas,

When we write something like 

  2x + 1 = 33

there are a limited number of values that can be assigned to the
variable to make the statement true.  In this case, there's only one,
which is x=16.  Any other assignment makes the statement false:

  2*16 + 1 = 33               True

   2*5 + 1 = 33               False

Sometimes there can be more than one value possible.  For example, in
the equation

  x^2 + 1 = 10

the value x=3 works, and so does the value x=-3:

   (3)^2 + 1 = 10              True

  (-3)^2 + 1 = 10              Also true.

Now, consider what happens when we throw another variable into the
mix.  Let's look at a simple example, like 

   2x + y = 5

Now we're looking, not for individual values, but for _pairs_ of
values that make the statement true.  For example, if I assign x=1 and
y=3, I get

   2*1 + 3 = 5 

which is true.  So the pair (x=1,y=3) is a solution to this equation.
For this particular equation, it's not hard to write down other pairs
that would work:

  (x =  0,   y = 5)
  (x = -1,   y = 7)
  (x =  1.5, y = 2)

A moment's thought should convince you that there are, in fact,
infinitely many pairs that satisfy the equation.  

By default, when we are using 'x' and 'y' for our variables, we agree
that we'll always write the x value first, which saves us some effort.
 The pairs above would then be written 

  (0, 5)
  (-1, 7)
  (1.5, 2)

Note that changing the order changes the meaning, so (0,5) is a
different thing from (5,0).  For this reason, we call these 'ordered
pairs'.  

So, we have an infinite number of possible solutions.  What do we do
about that?  Surely we can't write them _all_ down!  It would take too
long (and we'd never be able to afford enough paper, or computer
memory, to do it).  

The short answer is:  We use a _graph_.  In theory, we would look at
each solution, and mark a corresponding point on a coordinate plane. 
If you're not sure how that works, look at 

  http://mathforum.org/cgraph/cplane/

If we did this for each solution of the equation

  2x + y = 5

the points would all form a line.  That is, the line and the equation
are just two different ways of representing the same set of (x,y) pairs.  

Other equations correspond to different kinds of curves.  For example,
if you plot all the solutions to the equation

  y = x^2 - 3x + 2 

the points corresponding to the solutions form a parabola.  If you
plot all the solutions to the equation

  (x-3)^2 + (y+5)^2 = 4^2

you get a circle (whose center is at the point (3,-5), and whose
radius is 4). 

Once the connection between equations and graphs is made, there are
two kinds of questions that are easy to ask.  The first is

  Given a particular equation, like  x^2 - y^2 = 4,
  what is the shape of the corresponding graph? 

The second is, 

  Given a particular graph, or a few points on a graph,
  what is the corresponding equation? 

Because it's so easy to ask these questions, you should expect to be
asked a lot of them.  :^D

You'll start with lines first, because those are the easiest to work
with.  If you'd like to get a head start on that, take a look at

I hope this helps!  Write back if you'd like to talk more about this,
or anything else.
