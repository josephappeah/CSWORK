Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Francis!

There are two patterns:

   s(n) = F(n+3) + 2,  or
   s(n) = n^3/6 - n^2/2 + 7*n/3 + 3.

How much evidence is required is a judgment call on your part.  I'd
give full credit to any answer, as long as the student could justify
it.  I like the first answer better (as you do, too, apparently)
because of Occam's Razor.  The simplest explanation is likely to be
the right one!

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
