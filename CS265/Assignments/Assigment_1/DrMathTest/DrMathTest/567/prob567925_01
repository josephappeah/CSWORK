You're right, it's 11 times.  Here's why:

After you've picked the set of 4 numbers that you're interested in,
there are 15 - 4 = 11 remaining numbers, and that last number
can be any of the 11.

If you want to know how many combinations there are with a
particular set of 3 numbers, say: 1, 2 and 3, then there are
15 - 3 = 12 available numbers and you need to choose two
of those in the remaining positions, so there are 12 choose 2
= 66 combinations that contain any particular set of three
numbers.
