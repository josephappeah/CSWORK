Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Sai!

If the point is (x0,y0,z0) and the direction cosines are (a, b, c),
then the equations of the line are

   (x-x0)/a = (y-y0)/b = (z-z0)/c.

In parametric form, you would have

   x = x0 + a*t,
   y = y0 + b*t,
   z = z0 + c*t.

To find the point of intersection with the plane

   A*x + B*y + C*z = D,

substitute the above parametric forms into the equation of the
plane, solve for t, and use that to find (x,y,z) for the point of
intersection.

The circle through these three points will have two simultaneous
equations.  One is the equation of the plane above.  The other
will have the form

(*)   x'^2 + y'^2 + s*x' + t*y' + u = 0,

where, for example,

   z' = (A*x + B*y + C*z)/sqrt(A^2+B^2+C^2),
   y' = (-C*x + A*z)/sqrt(A^2+C^2),
   x' = (-A*B*x + [A^2+C^2]*y - B*C*z)/
                         (sqrt[A^4+A^2*B^2+2*A^2*C^2+B^2+C^2+C^4].

Substitute these last two into (*), expand and simplify, and you'll
have the second equation of the circle.  To determine s, t, and u,
substitute in the coordinates of the three points on the circle,
and you'll get a system of three simultaneous linear equations in
those three unknowns, which you can solve.

Then the radius of the circle will be sqrt(s^2/4+t^2/4-u), and its
center will be at the intersection of

   x' = -s/2,
   y' = -t/2,
   A*x + B*y + C*z = D.

Solve these simultaneously for x, y, and z, and you'll have the
coordinates of the center of the circle.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
