Hi Bidemi,

>As regards ealier asked question "Are all Rational numbers FRACTIONS" 
>please there is a bit confusion here which i'm not clear about. 
>First, a rational number is a fraction in the form p/q, where p and q

>in the form p/q i.e an integer over an integer 

A fraction is more general.  The numerator and denominator aren't
required to be zero.  So 2/3 and e/pi are both fractions, but of the
two only 2/3 is a rational number. 

>Now in fraction, can q equals to Zero, i.e is 1/0 a fraction

No, it's not. More precisely, it's a fraction whose value is undefined. 

>Is o/1 a fraction

Yes, it is. 

>is o/o a fraction.

Similarly, it's a fraction whose value is undefined.

No, we know it doesn't, not in the sense in which we normally use
'recurring' or 'repeating'.  

>but the value of pi was assumed to be 22/7 

That's just an estimate.  

>now 22/7 is an integer over an integer and the denominator is not 
>equal to zero which is enough to classify it as a rational number. 

Right.  22/7 is a rational number, but 22/7 is only an _approximation_
to pi, which is not rational.  3.14, which is the same as 314/100, is
also a rational approximation to pi; as is 3.14159, which is the same
as 314159/100000; and so on.

>Also pi/2 is classified as a fraction not a rational number because 
>pi is not an integer but pi/2 is the same thing as 22/7 divided by 2 

But it's _not_ the same thing.  It's an _approximation_.

>which equals 11/7 now 11/7 can be viewed as a rational number since 
>it is an integer over an integer. 

Sorry.  See above.

The decimal expansion of a rational number does terminate, or reach a
point where you get a repeating cycle of digits, e.g., 

                _
  3.3333... = 3.3

or
                      __
  3.45676767... = 3.4567

>while an irrational number is such in the form root of a number where 
>the number is a natural number and has a re-occuring decimal i.e the 
>root of 2 

No, that's just one example of an irrational number.  There are lots
of others that aren't the roots of integers.  

>a fraction is an integer over an integer in the form p/q 
>(can both p and q be zero)

A fraction is just a number divided by a number, e.g., 

    1
  -------
  1 + 1/2

is a fraction, and so is 

     _
   \/2
  -----
   pi

and so is

  2 + i
  ------
  3 - 4i

and so on. 

>does that means that only those numbers in the root and has re-

No.  Maybe you'd find this helpful:

I'm not sure what you mean by 'approving'.

What happens in 12 hours?
