Hi Glen,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  My computers says there are 8
different solutions (and 8 more if you allow a=0).  When there are
lots of solutions, sometimes the best way to find one is just trial
and error.

In fact, in none of those solutions does c+f=i or g+h=i.  In fact, in
all 8 of them,

  c+f = g+h = 10+i.

So you should be aware that carries might come out of one column into
the next.  It also might be helpful to write them as

  100*a + 10*b + c + 100*d + 10*e + f = 100*g + 10*h + i

and so on.  But all of these are just helps, and since there is more
than one solution, be assured that you will not be able to determine
each variable one at a time; you will always have a couple of cases at
least.  So there is some trial and error that will always be necessary.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
