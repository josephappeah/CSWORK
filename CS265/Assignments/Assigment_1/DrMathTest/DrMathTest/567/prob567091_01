I don't know what a tirth is. If I assume that you meant to 
type "third", here is how I do it.

If the two girls finish 1/3 of the stamps in 3 hours, then I think 
it's clear that they would take 9 hours to finish all the work.

Suppose they worked by each taking 1/2 the stamps. Then in the 9 
hours, each would finish 1/2 the work. Thus, one alone would take 
twice as long, or 18 hours, to do all the work.

If it takes 18 hours for one girl to do all the work, then in one 
hour, one girl would do 1/18 of the work.

With three girls working, in one hour each would do 1/18 of the work, 
so together they would do 3/18 = 1/6 of the work.

If 1/6 of the work is done in 1 hour, then the full job would take 6 
times as long, or 6 hours.

However, the question wasn't how long it would take 3 girls to do the 
WHOLE job, but how long it would take them to FINISH the job -- to do 
the part that is left. They had done 1/3 of the job, so they have 2/3 
left to do. If it takes 6 hours to do the whole job, it takes 2/3 * 6 
= 4 hours to do 2/3 of the job. That's the answer, 4 hours. Perhaps 
you did everything right except what I've said in this paragraph.

Once you've got these concepts under your belt, you can understand 
the algebraic way to solve the same problem. The formula is

  Work done = Rate * Time * Number of people

where the rate is the fraction of the job done per hour per person. 
That's more complex than the basic rate equation, but the idea is the 
same.

If two people do 1/3 of the job in 3 hours, we've got

  1/3 job = Rate * 3 hours * 2 people

Solve for the rate:

  Rate = 1/3 / 3 / 2
  Rate = 1/18 job per hour per person

Now 3 people, working at the same rate, take how long to do the 
remaining 2/3 of the job?

  2/3 job = 1/18 job/hour/person * x hours * 3 people
  2/3 = 1/18 * x * 3
  2/3 = (3 * 1/18)x
  2/3 = 1/6 x
  (2/3)/(1/6) = x
  4 = x
