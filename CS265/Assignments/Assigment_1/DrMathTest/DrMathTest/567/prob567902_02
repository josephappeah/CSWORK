Hi, Keith --

>It is generally reported that 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... (ad infinitum) = 2

It is not only generally reported to be so; it is in fact so....

>...(or approaches but never reaches 2)

When you say "approaches but never reaches 2", you are talking in 
the finite sense.  Yes, in the finite sense, the series will never 
reach 2, but the infinite series is equal to 2.

>Would it be safe to say that no matter how close the left side of

Not really.  As long as we are talking in the finite sense, the 
series is always short by some tiny but finite amount.  In the 
infinite sense the series is equal to 2; it is not short by any 
amount.

>If this is so, would it be accurate to say that 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 ... 
>(ad infinitum) = 2 - (an infinite series (IS))?

I don't understand what you are trying to do here... but again, if 
you take the series "ad infinitum", then it is equal to 2; it is not 
short by any amount.

I don't know where you got this; perhaps you are taking it out of 
context.  It is certainly not true.  For example

  .1 + .01 + .001 + ... = 1/9

1/9 is not an irrational number...

I hope some of this helps.  You need to understand the difference 
between finite and infinite to be comfortable with this material.
