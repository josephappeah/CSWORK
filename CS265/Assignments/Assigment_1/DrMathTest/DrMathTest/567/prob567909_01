Hi Ron,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  No, the expression you put in
parentheses is either true or false, and it cannot equal a number like
e/2.  Rather, the first statement,

  0 < |x-3| < a = e/2

is really three different statements:

  0 < |x-3|,
  |x-3| < a, and
  a = e/2.

So it means that zero is less than the absolute value of x-3, which is
less than a, which equals e/2.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
