Hello Robert,

I would have to know more about the geometry involved before I could answer.

If, for example, one had a horizontal line, from A to B, and it were d inches long, then one 
might ask where would point B go if AB were pivoted about A and moved counterclockwise 
through 3 degrees.

The answer is that B would go up and to the left.

Specifically,

B would go up by d*sin(3deg)  and would move to the left by d - d*cos(3deg).

Write back if you wish and it's not too late.
