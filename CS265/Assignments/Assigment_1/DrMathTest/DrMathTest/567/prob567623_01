Hi Brad,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  A function is odd if f(-x) = -f(x).

To determine if f(x) is odd, replace every x in the formula for f(x)
and see if you can rewrite the resulting expression as -f(x), or
-1 times the formula for f(x).  For example, if f(x) = x^3 - 3x,

   f(-x) = (-x)^3 - 3(-x)

         = -x^3 + 3x

         = -(x^3 - 3x)
 
         = - f(x) .

If you graph y=f(x), then for each point (x,y) on the graph, the point
(-x,-y) is also on the graph.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
