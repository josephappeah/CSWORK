Hi Elizabeth,

'x' just stands for some number whose value we don't know yet.  Since
x is between -1 and 0, it could be -0.5, or -1/3, or -0.0001, or
-0.999, or some other number.  We just don't know. 

In arithmetic, we're always dealing with numbers whose values we know,
e.g., 

  3 * 6 = 18

In algebra, we start applying the rules of arithmetic to numbers whose
values we _don't_ know, at least not exactly.  For example, if I know
that x is some number at least 2 and not more than 3, then the value
of the expression

  3 * x = ?

can be as low as 6, since

  3 * 2 = 6

and as high as 9, since

  3 * 3 = 9

The actual value of the result, '?', is somewhere in that range, even
though we can't say exactly where it is.  

Does that make sense?  Can you see how to answer your question?
