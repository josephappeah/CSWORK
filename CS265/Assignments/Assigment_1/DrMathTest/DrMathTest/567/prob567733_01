Hi Bill,

Pi is not random.  It's got a definite value. 

However, the digits of the decimal expansion of pi appear to be
randomly distributed.  This doesn't mean that they appear randomly! 
It just means that if you grab any big section of the decimal
expansion, you'll find that all the digits appear about the same
number of times, that they don't seem to be clustered in any
predictable way, and so on. 

Do you see the difference?  Basically, they're only random when you
don't take _order_ into account.  If you take the same digits and
place them in a different order, you get something other than pi.

Does this help?
