Hi Angelo,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  There are several polyhedra with 8
vertices, so can you be more specific.  For example, how many faces
are there?  How many sides does each face have?  How many edges are
there?  How many edges meet at each of the 8 vertices?  For example,
your answers might be:

  11 faces, 10 with three sides (triangles), 1 with four sides,
  17 edges,
  6 vertices meet 4 edges each, 2 vertices meet 5 edges each.

This polyhedron doesn't have a special name - it would be called an
"undecahedron" because it has 11 faces.  In fact, much like polygons,
very few polyhedra have special names other than to count to number of
faces.  Yours is probably one of those.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
