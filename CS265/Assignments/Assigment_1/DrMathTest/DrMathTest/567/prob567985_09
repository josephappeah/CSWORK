But this is exactly how you show that 0^i doesn't have a sensible
definition.  So far, you've shown that 0^i must, in fact, have one of
two values if it's going to have any value at all: it must be equal to
zero, or it must be equal to one.  

From here, what you want to do is find out whether either of those
choices makes sense.  If each choice leads to a contradiction, then no
choice is possible... which is what we were trying to show.
