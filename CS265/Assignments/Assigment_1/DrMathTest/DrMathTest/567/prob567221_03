Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Maggie!

You've done fine so far.  Now you have to figure out the values of
a and b from the equations a^2 = 1/3 and b^2 = 1/4.  Then you'll
have the equation in the standard form x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1.

By the way, this is the equation of an ellipse, not a parabola.

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
