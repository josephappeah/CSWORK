Hi Dekey,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  First, do you know any functions
which do not have a limit at some point x=a?  If you can think of
one, call it f(x), then try to think of a function g(x) such that
f(x) + g(x) doesn't have the "bad" behavior of f(x).  g(x) needs 
to "counteract" the bad behavior of f(x) in some way.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
