Hi Mahdi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

>I think this is cooresponding to this integral:
>(x^2/1+x^4)dx=dy

That is correct.  The resulting integral can be solved by using
Partial Fractions, after factoring the denominator

  1 + x^4 = (x^2 - sqrt(2)x + 1)(x^2 + sqrt(2)x + 1) .

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
