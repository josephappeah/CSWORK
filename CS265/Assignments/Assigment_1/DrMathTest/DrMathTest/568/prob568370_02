What do you do in algebra when you have a formula to calculate "this"
in terms of "that", but you know "this" and want to find "that"? You
solve for "that".

Do that here. Call the other endpoint (x,y) and write equations that
say the midpoint is (3,8). Then solve for x and y.

There are other ways you could do this as well, by thinking of it
geometrically, but this algebraic method is probably best for you.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
