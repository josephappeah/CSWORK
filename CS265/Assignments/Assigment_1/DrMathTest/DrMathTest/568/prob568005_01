Hello Taylor,

Are you asking for the equation of the plane?  I don't think so, but, just in case, it is
A*x+B*y+C*z+D=0, where A, B, C, and D are constants.

Otherwise, there isn't really a "proper notation" for a plane.  It may be that the textbook 
has some preferred method and you should look  in the text to see if you can figure out 
their preferred notation.
