You've got it just right.  There are many ways to think about it, 
and you should choose the way that makes most sense to you.  Here's 
one:

Half the families have a boy first.
Half of this half have a boy first, then a boy second. (1/4)
Half of this 1/4 also have a boy third (1/8)
Half of this 1/8 also have a boy fourth (1/16)

(Of course, the real world doesn't work this way, and some couples 
seem more prone to having a boy, so after 3 boys in a row, the 
probability of the next child being a boy isn't really 1/2.  This is 
different from coin flips, where each time you flip the coin, the 
probability really is 1/2 for "heads".)
