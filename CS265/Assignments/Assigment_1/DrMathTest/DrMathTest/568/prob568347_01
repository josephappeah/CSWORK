Hello, Lloyd --

There is a very nice geometric explanation of why the result to the 
current point is doubled when determining the next digit of the 
answer.  Is your method a geometric method?

There are several pages in the Dr. Math archives where the process 
of finding square roots by hand is discussed.  You say you looked at 
an explanation somewhere on our web site, but we don't know which 
one.  I could not find anywhere on our web site anything like the 
geometric explanation of the method I have in mind.  And I have no 
idea which explanations you might have been looking at.

We are a collection of several "math doctors" answering questions 
sent in by readers; there isn't really any email address where you 
can send your explanation.  If you want us to look at it, just send 
it along as part of a question you send to us....
