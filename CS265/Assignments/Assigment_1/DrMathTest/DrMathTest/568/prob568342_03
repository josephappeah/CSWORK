Hello Steve,

The equation (x-Cx)^2 + (y-Cy)^2 + (z-Cz)^2 = r^2 describes a sphere, not a circle.

Suppose we want to describe a circle with radius r, center (cx,cy,cz),  and in the plane 
determined by the mutually perpendicular unit vectors u1 and u2.  A parametric/vector 
description is  (I use {a,b,c} to indicate a vector a*i+b*j+c*k.)

f(t) = {cx,cy,cz} + r*cos(t)*u1 + r*sin(t)*u2,  0 <= t <= 2*pi.

OK, suppose we have such a circle and want to project it onto a plane described by
A*x+B*y+C*z+D = 0.  We write the equation of a line through an arbitrary point of the 
circle and in the direction of the normal {A,B,C} of the given plane.  Such an equation is

g(s)= f(t) + s*{A,B,C}, -oo < s < oo.

We need to choose s so that the components of g(u) satisfy the equation 
A*x+B*y+C*z+D=0.  The variable s thus found will be a function of  t.  If we replace s by 
this function of t in the equation for g(s) we will have an equation for the projection.
