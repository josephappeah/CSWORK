Hi Dave,

>A new (?) book states that the former's 1 in 39,000/ the later's, 
>1 in 3.7 million. Is the probabily of BOTH (to one individual) 1 in 
>(39,000 TIMES 3.7 million)?

That would be the case if the events are independent.  When you're
doing things like rolling dice and drawing cards from a deck, it's
easy to declare independence (ha, ha).  But when you're talking about
real-world events, it's not so easy.  

For example, let's suppose that in a given year in the United States,
3 million people a year suffer from chicken pox , and 3 million people
a year suffer from strokes.  (I'm just making these numbers up, by the
way, because the actual values aren't relevant to the point I'm trying
to make.) 

We might easily conclude that given a population of 300 million or so,
the probability that you'll get chicken pox in a given year is about 1
in 300, and the probability that you'll get a stroke in a given year
is about 1 in 300, so the probability that you'll get BOTH chicken pox
and a stroke in a given year is 1 in 300^2.  

We might easily conclude that, but we would be wrong.  :^D

Why?  Because most people who get chicken pox are less than 12 years
old, and post people who have strokes are more than 50 years old.  So
the actual probability we want is given by Bayes's theorem, 

  P(pox,stroke) = P(stroke|pox) * P(pox)

where

  P(pox,stroke)     is the probability of getting both chicken
                    pox AND a stroke in the same year.

  P(stroke|pox)     is the probability of getting a stroke in 
                    a given year, PROVIDED that you've have 
                    chicken pox in the same year. 

  P(pox)            is the probability of getting chicken pox
                    in a given year. 

For independent events, P(B|A) is the same as P(B) - in fact, that's
how we _define_ independence.   But let's consider 

  P(stroke|pox)

This will be close to, but not exactly the same as, 

  P(age < 12 | age > 50)

which is, of course, zero.  So the combined probability, 

  P(pox,stroke)

is very, very much smaller than 1 in 300^2.  Does that make sense? 

In your case, the situation looks like

  P(lightning,shark) = P(shark|lightning) * P(lightning)

So what you need to ask yourself is:  To what extent are being struck
by lightning and being attacked by a shark independent?  

That's more a science question than math question; but one way to
think about it is to consider the kinds of people who tend to suffer
lightning strikes and shark attacks.  It's possible that, just as with
chicken pox and strokes, these are largely disjoint populations (e.g.,
perhaps lightning strikes mostly people who live in inland areas,
while sharks attack mostly people who live on the coasts).  In that
case, the conditional probability 

  P(shark|lightning)

would be very close to zero, and the chances of suffering both a
lightning strike and a shark attack would also be close to zero. 

On the other hand, the two populations might overlap completely, in
which case 

  P(shark|lightning) = P(shark)

and 

  P(lighting,shark) = P(shark) * P(lightning)

Does this help?

As they say, it's never too late to have a happy childhood.  :^l

But maybe that's a good thing.  A steel trap will catch anything that
comes into it, whether it's worth catching or not...
