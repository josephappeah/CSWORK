Hi Andrew,

Do you mean that she used that angle to figure out something else?  Or
she calculated that angle starting with other information? 

Just out of curiosity, can you show me the exact wording of the problem?

There are in fact a lot of instruments that are designed to measure
angles:

But in a made-up problem, the author of the problem could just provide
her with that information.  :^D

You could use one of the instruments mentioned above; or you could
simply use similar triangles (observe the highest point from two
points along the same line of sight); or you could estimate the height
from the time of flight, using the equations of projectile motion.

See the list above.
