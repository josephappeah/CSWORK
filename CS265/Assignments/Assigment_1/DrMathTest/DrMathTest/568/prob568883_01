Hi Mick,

Good job researching the various uses of the (often abused) word
"proper". I can tell you that the most common usage I've seen
is the one you described (subsets of A not equal to A). As for the
empty set, it is usually described as the trivial subset, but it is 
still considered a proper subset (unless A={}, then the empty set
is both a trivial and improper subset).

I'm not sure if you could trace the terminology back to a single
mathematician, but you could probably argue that whoever talked
about sets first was likely the one that introduced the term.
Since Cantor is considered the father of set theory, your guess
is well founded :-)

As for your first question "strictly contained in" vs. "contained in",
I believe that it's simply a matter of logical simplicity. It is much
much simpler to write

 A is a subset of B iff every element of A is also in B

than throwing extra conditions in there that ensure the two sets
are not equal.

Practically speaking, it's just the opposite. One could pretty
much define set equality as the requirement that you have *both*
conditions A subset B, and B subset A. It is a common proof technique 
that you see over and over again in all branches of mathematics that 
deal with sets (linear algebra, topology, etc..). I can give you an 
example of a proof that does exactly that, if you're interested.
Although, you should be able to find plenty of examples where this 
technique is used, if you look around a bit.

In other words, it is much more logically elegant and practical to 
keep the "contained in" concept as the basic one rather than the
slightly more complex "strictly contained in" concept. Note that
if you consider the latter as the basic concept, you'd have to
define equality of sets first. With the former, you could define
equality after the fact.

Well, I hope this helped!

Let us know if you have any more questions.
