Hi Heather,

I assume you'd like to make it work so that if one person earned twice
what the other did, then that person would pay twice as much, right?

If so, here's how to do the calculation:

Suppose you earn A and the other person earns B.

Your share is A/(A+B) of the total, and the other person's share
is B/(A+B).

In your example, person 1 would owe 67151/(67151+52039)
of the total or .5633 of the total or (.5633)(1119) = 630.43.

The same idea will work for any number of people.  For example,
if four people earn A, B, C and D, then the one who earns A will
pay A/(A+B+C+D), the B earner will pay B/(A+B+C+D), and so on.

Maybe it'll help you see why this works, since:

A/(A+B+C) + B/(A+B+C) + C/(A+B+C) = (A+B+C)/(A+B+C) = 1,

so the three proportions add to 1 -- the full amount.
