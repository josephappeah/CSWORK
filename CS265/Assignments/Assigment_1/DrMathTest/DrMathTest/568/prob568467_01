Do what you would do if there were a number there in place of the c; 
after all, the c does stand for some number. Expand using the 
distributive property:

  5(3 - 2/7) = 5*3 - 5*2/7
             = 15 - 10/7

When the c is there, you can't do that last multiplication, but you 
can rearrange factors in the last term to make it neater:

  5(3 - c/7) = 5*3 - 5*c/7
             = 15 - (5/7)c

Your second thought is correct.
