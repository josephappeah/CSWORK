Hi Em,

It depends on what kind of calculator you have.  If it's got
something like y^x (raise y to the x-th power), then just
use x = 1/3.  In other words

cube_root(x) = x^(1/3)

If you don't have that, but have ln(x) and e^x, you can do
it like this:

cube_root(x) = e^(ln(x)/3)

To make sure you know what you're doing, try it on an
example where you know the answer; for example:

cube_root(8) = 2.
