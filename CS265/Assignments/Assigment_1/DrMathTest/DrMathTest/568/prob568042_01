Hi, Vanessa --

I suppose you are using the ' to indicate a measurement in degrees.  
That just confuses things, so let's do the problem without the 
units.  We have, as you say,

  x+y = 180

You don't define what x and y are; presumably, they are the angle 
and its supplement -- but I don't know which is which.  So I'm going 
to say

  x = angle
  y = supplement

  x+y = 180

Now you need to use the other information given in the problem.  We 
are told the angle is half its supplement.  We could then write

  x = (1/2)y

But I always like to avoid fraction whenever possible, because they 
are harder to work with than whole numbers.  So I am going to say, 
instead,

  y = 2x

The equation in this form says the supplement is twice the angle -- 
which is the same as saying the angle is half its supplement.

So now we have

  x+y = 180
  y = 2x

Using substitution, we then get

  x+2x = 180
  3x =  180
  x = 60
  y = 2x = 120

The angle is 60 degrees and its supplement is 120 degrees.
