Hi Joshua,

>The area of a lot is 21 square feet, owner wants to increase it by 
>1/2. What would be the new area.

If I increase something by half, I add half of what it already is, to
itself.  

For example, if the cost of an item is $100, and I increase it by
half, I first

  1) find out what half of it is:  1/2 * 100 = 50.

  2) I add the half to the original:  100 + 50 = 150

So if I increase 100 by half, I get 150. 

>Its sad but I cannot figure out how to set it up to solve it.

Can you see how to do it now?

It sounds like you're having some trouble with the concept of area. 
Try looking at

and let me know if it's not clear, or if you still have questions.
