Hi Cleo,

It might have been nice if the book mentioned how it works with three,
but you are correct that you can derive this formula from the formula
for 2, like so:

  P(E, F, or G) = P( (E or F) or G )
          = P(E or F) + P(G) - P( (E or F) & G )

then you notice that

  (E or F) & G = (E & G) or (F & G)

and continue:

  P( (E or F) & G ) = P( (E & G) or (F & G) )
         = P(E & G) + P(F & G) + P(E & G & F & G)

but, of course, (E & G) & (F & G) = E & F & G, so we put it all
together as:

  P(E, F, or G) = P( (E or F) or G )
          = P(E or F) + P(G) - P( (E or F) & G )
          = [P(E) + P(F) - P(E & F)] + P(G)
             - [P(E & G) + P(F & G) + P(E & F & G)]

which simplifies to the expression I gave you.

The idea is:  Say you have m variables, and you want the probability
that any one of them is true - P(E1 or E2 or ... or Em).  Then you add
up the probabilities that each one of them is true - P(E1) + P(E2) +
... + P(Em) - but you find that you double-count every place where two
of them are true (and triple-count any place where three are true, and
so on).  So then you subtract off all m*(m+1)/2 probabilities that any
two of the variables are true - P(E1 & E2), P(E1 & E3), ... - and now
you've fixed all the places where exactly two of the variables are
true, but you've subtracted off three times all the places where
exactly three of the variables are true, so you have to add those back
in.  You add in all m-choose-3 probabilities that three of the
variables are true - P(E1 & E2 & E3), ....  And so on, alternating
adding and then subtracting, adding and then subtracting.
