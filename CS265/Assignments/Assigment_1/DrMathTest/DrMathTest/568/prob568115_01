>(D/2)^2 + (D/2)^2 = (D/2 + x)^2

Hi Chris.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

A diagram might help:


  +-E--------A             air duct is centered at O, and distance
  F X                      AO = OB = OC = D.
  |   C
  |                        water pipe is centered at X, and touches
  |                        walls at E and F, and duct at C, so
  B          O             CX = XE = XF = x.             

Can you finish from here?
