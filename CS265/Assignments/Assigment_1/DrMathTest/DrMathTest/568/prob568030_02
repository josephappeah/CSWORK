Hi Amy,

Thanks for the question.

Here is a circle drawn inside a rectangle:

  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _11_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 |              *   *                    |
 |          *           *                |
 |                                       |
 |       *                 *             |
 |                                       |
 |      *         .         *            |8
 |                                       |
 |       *                 *             |
 |                                       |
 |          *           *                |
 | _ _ _ _ _ _ _*_ _*_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ |

Can you see from the diagram that the diameter (distance across 
circle through the centre) of the largest circle that will fit is 8?

There is a formula which we use to find the area of a circle:

    Area = Pi * Radius * Radius

Or simplified that is:

    Area = Pi * Radius^2      [where ^2 means squared].

Now, Pi is a number. It is always the same - it is roughly 3.14. Out 
of interest, it is the circumference of any circle (distance around 
the outside) divided by the diameter.

The radius is the distance from the centre of a circle to the 
outside. It is therefore half of the diameter. Can you see why?

So for our circle we have a radius of 8/2 = 4. This gives:

    Area = Pi * Radius * Radius

    Area = 3.14 * 4 * 4

Can you work that out to find the area?

By the way, if you would like to know where the formula for the area 
of a circle came from, it is explained here:

Does that help? 

Write back if you want any of those steps explaining in more detail, 
or if you have any other questions.
