Hi Joe,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Your question is in a specialized 
area called geodesy, and you need to check geodesy sites.  The most 
popular algorithm for the computation you describe seems to be 
Vincenty's Algorithm, which is in the paper at

   http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/inverse.pdf  .

A listing of a program implementing this algorithm is at

   http://wiki.tcl.tk/9325 

and you can find other references by doing a search on "Vincenty's 
algorithm".  Some sites have online calculators if you just need to
make a few computations.  Another good resource for geodesy is

  http://www.icsm.gov.au/icsm/gda/gdatm/ .

I hope you find some of these helpful.
