I assume you meant those to be absolute value bars:

  |18| - |-2|

First find the absolute values of 18 and -2, and put those numbers in
place of the symbols. Then subtract. Only one of your answers is
correct, and you should see which it is.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
