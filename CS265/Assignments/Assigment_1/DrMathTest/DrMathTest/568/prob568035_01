Hi Maranda,

Checking the discriminant of the denominator, 

  sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) = sqrt((-4)^2 - 4(1)(8))

                  = sqrt(16 - 32)

shows that it's not factorable... which tells you something important,
i.e., that it's a parabola that doesn't intersect the x-axis.  It's
always positive. 

This means there aren't any places where the denominator goes to zero,
which eliminates one source of asymptotes.  The remaining ones, if
any, occur as x tends to infinity or negative infinity.  To figure out
what happens there, you would want to consider what happens as the x^2
term dwarfs all the other terms.  What will happen to the value of the
entire expression?
