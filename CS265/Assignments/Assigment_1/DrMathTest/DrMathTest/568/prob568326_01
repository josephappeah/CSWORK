We can write your example in general terms like this:

  BasePrice + BasePrice * TaxRate/100 = PriceWithTax

  100 + 100 * 6.5 / 100 = 106.5

Notice that you don't just multiply by 6.5% (that just gives the 
tax), you have to add it to the base price to get the total price. 
You knew that, you just didn't write it.

There is another way to write this, if you remember anything about 
the distributive property:

  BasePrice * (1 + TaxRate/100) = PriceWithTax

  100 * (1 + 6.5/100) = 106.5

Now we can use some algebra to work backward. We know the 
PriceWithTax but we don't know the BasePrice, so I'll call the base 
price x:

  x * (1 + 6.5/100) = 106.5

That is,

  x * 1.065 = 106.5

Divide both sides by 1.065:

  x = 106.5/1.065
    = 100

In general, our formula is

  BasePrice = PriceWithTax / (1 + TaxRate/100)

How's that? If anything I've said confuses you, I'll be glad to 
answer your questions.
