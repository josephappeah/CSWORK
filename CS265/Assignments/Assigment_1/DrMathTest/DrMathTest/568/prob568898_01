Hi, Marcia --

I'm not sure I have the picture correctly.  My interpretation is 
that you have a row of rectangles lined up end to end, and you want 
to find the total number of rectangles of any size.  So the 
teacher's example you mention with six rectangles has those six 
rectangles in one row -- instead of in two rows of three each.

One good way to solve this problem is to analyze "simple" cases with 
small numbers of rectangles; specifically, it is often useful to see 
what happens when you start with a small number of rectangles and 
then add one more.

So let's do the following:

(1) determine how many rectangles there are altogether if we have 
just two small rectangles end to end; then
(2) determine how many "new" rectangles we get when we add a third 
small rectangle to the row

With two small rectangles, we have a total of three rectangles -- 
the two small ones, and the one formed by the two small rectangles 
together.  Let's develop a way of describing these three rectangles.

Here is a picture of the case with two rectangles:

  +-------+-------+
  |       |       |
  0       1       2
  |       |       |
  +-------+-------+

I have labeled the vertical lines in this diagram so that I 
can "name" the three rectangles in the figure, as follows:

  (1) the rectangle formed by vertical lines 0 and 1;
      I'll call that "(0,1)"
  (2) the rectangle formed by vertical lines 0 and 2;
      I'll call that "(0,2)"
  (3) the rectangle formed by vertical lines 1 and 2;
      I'll call that "(1,2)"

Now let's see what happens when we add a third small rectangle to 
the figure.  Our figure now looks like this:

  +-------+-------+-------+
  |       |       |       |
  0       1       2       3
  |       |       |       |
  +-------+-------+-------+

We of course still have the three rectangles we had before; let's 
determine how many new rectangles we have.  The only new vertical 
line in the figure is the labeled "3"; all "new" rectangles for this 
case must have line #3 as the right end.  We have 3 choices for the 
other end of the new rectangle -- lines 0, 1, or 2.  We therefore 
get 3 "new" rectangles by adding the 3rd small rectangle to our 
figure.

So when we add the 3rd small rectangle to the figure, we add 3 to 
the total number of rectangles.  A similar analysis will easily show 
that when you add the 4th small rectangle, you get 4 new 
rectangles.  And it should be clear that this pattern will continue; 
when you add the n-th small rectangle to the figure, you get n new 
rectangles.

So the incomplete answer to the original problem is that, if you 
have n small rectangles in a row, the total number of rectangles is

  1+2+3+...+n

For the final answer, you probably want to express this sum in a 
more useful form.  You may be familiar with an expression (formula) 
for the sum of the integers from 1 to n; the formula is

                (n)(n+1)
  1+2+3+...+n = --------
                    2

So, for example, if there are 10 small rectangles in a row, the 
total number of rectangles is

  (10)(11)   110
  -------- = --- = 55
      2       2

There is a much more sophisticated method for finding the answer to 
this problem, using a method with which you are probably not yet 
familiar.  But if you are in 7th grade, you will probably be 
learning this method soon.  So let me show it to you quickly.

Suppose we have our array of n small rectangles:

  +-------+-------+--- ... ---+
  |       |       |           |
  0       1       2           n
  |       |       |           |
  +-------+-------+--- ... ---+

In order to form a rectangle, basically all we need to do is choose 
two of the vertical lines in the figure.  Each distinct choice of 
two of those vertical lines will give us a distinct rectangle; and 
every distinct rectangle will be the result of a particular choice 
of those two vertical lines.  So the number of rectangles in the 
array of small rectangles is equal to the number of ways of choosing 
two of the vertical lines.

There are (n+1) vertical lines in the array (because the first one 
is labeled "0"), so we have (n+1) choices for the first vertical 
line.  Then we have n choices left for the other vertical line.  So 
the number of ways we can choose one of the lines and then another is

  (n+1)(n)

However, for each rectangle we can find, we can get that rectangle 
two different ways -- we can choose the "leftmost" vertical line 
first and the rightmost one second, or the other way around.  So in 
fact the number of ways we can choose two of the (n+1) vertical 
lines is

  (n+1)(n)
  --------
      2

This is the same result we got earlier by our other method.

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
