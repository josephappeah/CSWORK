Hi Brian,

One pencil costs 200D/p cents.  This means that one cent will buy
1/(200D/p), or p/(200D) pencils.  So c cents should by cp/(200D)
pencils, no? 

It can be helpful to check something like this with examples. Let's
try that:

  10 pencils cost (2*3) dollars.  How many pencils can we
  buy for 120 cents? 

10 pencils cost 6 dollars, or 600 cents.  So each pencil is 60 cents.
Which means that for 120 cents, we can buy 2 pencils.

Using your answer, 

  200D   200*3     600   1
  ---- = ------ = ---- = -
   pc    10*120   1200   2

Using mine,

   cp    10*120   1200
  ---- = ------ = ---- = 2
  200D   200*3     600

So, where did you get off track? 

  p pencils cost 2D dollars
  p pencils cost 2D * 100 cents
  p pencils cost 200D cents
  1 pencil  cost 200D/p cents

Everything looks good up to here. 

  (200D/p cents) / (c cents)

Let's look at the units of this quantity:

   200D
   ---- cents/pencil
    p                                      -1  
 -------------------- = (200D)/(pc) [pencil  ]
    c   cents

That is, your units are 'per pencil', rather than 'pencils'.  You want
the inverse of this.  

I think it's not an accident that you got into trouble as soon as you
stopped writing equations (using 'costs' instead of '='), and just
wrote a quantity, without asserting that it was equal to anything.

Always writing equations provides a valuable benefit, which is that if
you start with a true equation, and always do the same thing to both
sides, you're guaranteed to end up with a true equation.  If you just
start writing down expressions, you're not guaranteed anything at all. 

Even so, a secondary lesson is that it's a good idea to keep your
units around for as long as possible. 

Does this help?
