On the first part, I don't think you've got the "most uniform 
coverage of water possible." You've spaced the sprinkler heads so 
that the coverage circles just touch. As the pipe moves across the 
field, a point in the field under the path of a sprinkler head will 
be within the coverage circle for some length of time (you can figure 
the time once you know the speed of the pipe), but a point in the 
field under the path of a point where the circles touch will only be 
getting water for an instant, so it will get much less water. You'll 
have to provide for overlap, as the problem suggests. To tell the 
truth, it looks to me like a tough challenge to quantify uniformity 
of coverage and determine how to maximize uniformity.

On the second part, remember that one inch of water means a VOLUME of 
1 inch times the area of the field. You can find the flow rate 
(volume per unit time) and work from there to find the speed you need.
