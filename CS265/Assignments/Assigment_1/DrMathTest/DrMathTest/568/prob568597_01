I can't see any method other than trial and error, though there is a 
lot of logic that can help decide what to try. There may be several 
answers.

Here's the beginning of my thinking that led to an answer (after 
several other false leads):

Start with 17, and try to subtract to get down to 7. We need to 
subtract 10 from it. Since 16 is too big, try dividing it by the 4. 
So far we have

  17 - 16/4 ...

That takes us down to 13; we need to subtract another 6. How can I 
make 6 from 8, 6, 3? I see a way ...

But your approach of working from the right is no less likely to 
produce an answer.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
