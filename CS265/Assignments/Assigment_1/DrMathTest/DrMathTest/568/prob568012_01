That's the correct first step: subtract 32 from each side. Let's 
review the reason for this.

You've got the equation

  F = (9/5)C + 32

You want to get C alone on one side of the equation. Think first of 
how you would evaluate the right side, if you put in some value for 
C. You first multiply that value by 9/5; then you add 32.

Now we want to reverse the evaluation process: to start with the 
answer and get back to C alone. We do this by undoing the steps in 
reverse order. 

Think about how you put your shoes and socks on in the morning. First 
you put on your socks, then you put on your shoes. In the evening you 
reverse this process, getting back to bare feet. How do you do it? 
First you take off your shoes (undoing the LAST thing you did), then 
you take off your socks (undoing the first thing you did). If you 
tried to do it differently, you'd have real problems!

Since the LAST thing you did in evaluating the expression was to add 
32, the FIRST thing you want to do in solving the equation is to 
subtract 32 -- to undo the addition. The next thing you want to do is 
to divide by 9/5, to undo the multiplication. (There is a way to 
write division by 9/5 as a multiplication; what way is that?)

Of course, whatever you to the right side of the equation, you must 
do just the same thing to the left side, to keep the equation 
balanced (to write an equivalent equation).
