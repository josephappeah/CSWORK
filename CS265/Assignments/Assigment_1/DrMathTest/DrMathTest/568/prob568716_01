Hi Shea,

It's sort of like asking, "In what year was language discovered?"  The
answer is another question:  "By whom?"  Every ancient civilization
that we know of discovered pi.  

As for "When?", they all discovered it before any of the records we've
seen.  So the simple answer is:  We don't know.
