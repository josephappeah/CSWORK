The first thing you need is to understand what the associative
property means; you can find it explained here:

  Properties glossary
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.property.glossary.html

One way you can add these three numbers is

  (5 + 91) + 11

which means that you FIRST add 5 and 91, and THEN you add 11 to the
result.

What other way could you do it, which is equivalent by the associative
property of addition?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
