You don't have to get rid of the fractions; you can solve this 
problem in exactly the same way you would a problem without 
fractions. For instance, to solve the inequality

  6 <= 3(3+x)

I'd do this:

  6/3 <= 3+x   (I'm dividing by a positive number so
                direction of inequality doesn't change)
  2 <= 3+x
  2-3 <= x
  -1 <= x

You can follow the same steps with your problem:

  6 <= (1/4)(3+x)
  6/(1/4) <= 3+x   (I'm dividing by a positive number so
                    direction of inequality doesn't change)
  24 <= 3+x
  24-3 <= x
  21 <= x

The only tricky thing about this is that you have to remember how to 
divide by a fraction:

  6/(1/4) = 6 * 4/1 = 24

But you learned that well, right?  ;-)

If you really want to get rid of fractions, the trick is to multiply 
both sides of the equation or inequality by the denominator (or a 
common denominator, if there is more than one fraction).

  6 <= (1/4)(3+x)
  24 <= 4*(1/4)(3+x)
  24 <= 3+x

That you can solve, right? It was a step in my first solution, too.
