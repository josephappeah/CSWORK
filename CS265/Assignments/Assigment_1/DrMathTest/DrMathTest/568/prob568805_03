Hi Mike,

Consider an arithmetic 'fact' like

  12 = 3 * 4

This has exactly the same meaning as 

  12 / 3 = 4

and 

  12 / 4 = 3

That is, division and multiplication are just two ways of looking at
the same thing, and when you've got one, you can always replace it
with the other by changing the form appropriately. 

Now look again at the formula 

  distance = rate * time

All three of the following have exactly the same meaning:

  distance = rate * time

  distance / rate = time

  distance / time = rate

They're just different ways of saying the same thing.  Which form
you'd want to use depends on what you know, and what you're trying to
find out.  If you have a rate and a time (e.g., someone traveled at 30
miles per hour for 3 hours), you use the first to find the distance. 

If you have a distance and a rate (e.g., someone traveled 100 miles at
50 miles per hour), you use the second to find the time.  

If you have a distance and a time (e.g., someone traveled 80 miles in
2 hours), you use the third to find the rate. 

Given any two, you can find the third.  This same kind of reasoning
will apply to other formulas, e.g., from geometry.  The formula for
the volume of a cylinder with radius R and height H is 

  V = pi * R^2 * H

If you know the radius and the height, you can use this to compute the
volume.  But what if you know the volume and the height?  Then you can
rearrange it, using the same reasoning as before, to look like
    _____________
  \/ V / (pi * H) = R

and now you can compute the radius.  Or if you know the volume and the
radius, you can rearrange it to look like 

  V / (pi * R^2) = H

and now you can use it to compute the height.  

When will you use this in your life?  It depends on what kind of life
you plan to have.  There's an excellent chance that you'll never use
it, and you may have a very comfortable and happy life anyway.  

But it's one thing to be _able_ to reason this way, and to follow this
kind of reasoning when presented by others, but _choose_ not to do it
on a daily basis; and it's quite another thing to be _unable to do it.
 In the latter case, you are, quite literally, placing yourself at the
mercy of other people who will be able to use specious but
mathematical-looking 'arguments' to deprive you of your liberty and
property without your being able to do much about it, or even
understand that it's happening to you. 

Think of some very young children you know, and think about how easy 
it is to lie to them, because there's so much that they don't 
understand. You can tell them anything, and if you sound sincere, they 
really have no way of knowing whether you're telling the truth or not.  
So they have no choice but to trust you. Adults who don't know 
mathematics are in the same boat, relative to people who are fluent in 
it.

As simply as I can put it: If you don't understand mathematical
reasoning, then the people who do understand it will be able to jerk
you around like a trout.

Does this help?
