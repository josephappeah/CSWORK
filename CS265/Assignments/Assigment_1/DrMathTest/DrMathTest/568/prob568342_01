Hello Steve,

The projection of a circle on a plane is never a hyperbola or parabola.

You say you have the equation of a circle in three-space.  If you have that equation and an 
equation of a plane, then it's not difficult to find the equation of the projection.

How one does this depends upon how you have described the circle.  Have you used a 
parmetric/vector form?  And how have you described the plane?
