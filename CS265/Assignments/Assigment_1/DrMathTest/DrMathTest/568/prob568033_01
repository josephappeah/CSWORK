There is no one systematic way to solve these problems, but you 
develop an arsenal of helpful tricks as you do more of them. Having a 
multiplication table in front of you can help, and writing equations 
can sometimes help. You learn to notice certain patterns of numbers, 
for instance, if a digit times the same digit ends in the same digit 
yet again, it could be 0, 1, 5, or 6. Take a look at this item from 
the Dr. Math Archives for an example of solving a classic cryptarithm:

  Finding the Digits of SEND + MORE = MONEY
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57968.html

For your simpler problem, the multiplication table can help: you're 
looking for a digit that, when multiplied by 3, ends in the same 
digit. Look down the 3-times column looking for a number whose units 
digit is the same as the row number.

The problem can also be done algebraically: the equation is

  3*a = 10m+a

which can be simplified to

  2a = 10m
  a = 5m

so that a must be a multiple of 5 (since m is an integer). There are 
thus two solutions: a=0, m=0 and a=5, m=1. The first is trivial and 
doesn't count for two reasons: 00 is not considered a two-digit 
number (we don't write initial zeros), and a and m are assumed to be 
different.
