Hi Michi,

Thanks for writing to Doctor Math.

If each slice had 1 calorie then together there would be 3 calories.
If each slice had 2 calories then together there would be 6 calories.
If each slice had 3 calories then together there would be 9 calories.

Do you see the pattern? The total number of calories is 3 times the 
number in each slice.

               3 = 3 x 1
               6 = 3 x 2
               9 = 3 x 3

So if there are c calories in each slice the total equals 3 x c.

Does that make sense? Write again if you need more help.
