Hi,

Hi Gigi,

Suppose we have a sum like 

   15 + 25 = ?

We might go ahead and just do the addition, but we might also notice
that both of these numbers are multiples of 5:

  5*3 + 5*5 = ?

That would allow us to use the distributive property to write it this way:

  5*(3 + 5) = ?

        5*8 = ?

        5*8 = 40

Now, for numbers like this, it's not so useful.  But when we start
using variables, this can help us write complicated expressions more
simply.  For example, suppose I have

  5x - 5y = ?

This is basically the same situation I was just in, so I can write

  5(x+y) = ?

Or if I have

  5x - 15 = ?

I can do this:

  5x - 5*3 = ?

  5(x - 3) = ?

This is one of the things we mean when we talk about 'factoring'. 
Basically, we're taking a sum of things, and rewriting it as a product
of things, i.e., identifying factors. 

Looking at 
  
  14d - 2 = ?

can you think of anything that evenly divides both 14d and 2?
