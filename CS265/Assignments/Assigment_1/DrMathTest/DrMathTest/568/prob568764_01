Hi Amy,

Thanks for writing to Doctor Math.

I can't follow your thoughts completely, but I think you are on 
track.

If Alan is still 10 miles from camp after turning right for 5 miles 
then it must be that his camp is on the north pole, and he has been 
driving in a circle around it.

That means he killed a polar bear, and polar bears are white.

Does that make sense? Write again if you need more help.
