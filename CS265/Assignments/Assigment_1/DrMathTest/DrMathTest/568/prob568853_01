Your first equation is a quadratic equation. The standard form is

  n^2 - n - 20 = 0

(We write n^2 for n to the 2nd power.) The quickest solution method 
is to use the quadratic formula. With the equation in standard form

  ax^2 + bx + c = 0

we identify the coefficients

  a = 1
  b = -1
  c = -20

then plug them into the formula

  x = (-b +or- sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2a)

  n = (-(-1) +or- sqrt((-1)^2 - 4*1*-20))/(2*1)
    = (1 +or- sqrt(1+80))/2
    = (1 +or- 9)/2
    = (1+9)/2 or (1-9)/2
    = 5 or -4

Try those solutions in the original equation and you'll find that 
they work.

If the equation has powers other than 1 (the variable itself) and 2 
(the variable squared), the problem *may* be much harder. The Doctor 
Math FAQ has a section on solving cubic and quartic equations 
(equations where the highest power is 3 and 4 respectively). Your 
example, however, is easy, because n^3 is the *only* power. We can 
write

  n^3 - 3 = 24
  n^3 = 27
  n = cube root of 27

A scientific calculator can give you the cube root, but in this case 
the solution is an integer so it's easy to find.
