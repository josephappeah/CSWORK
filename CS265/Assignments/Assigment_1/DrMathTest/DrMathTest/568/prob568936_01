Hi Angela,

Wow, only two?  It's hardly ever the case that there are only two ways
to do anything.  :^D

Apart from the vagueness of 'work out' and 'if the problem has', that
seems like a reasonable approach.

You can always write a decimal as a fraction, e.g., 3.2 is the same as
32/10.  So you can multiply decimals by multiplying fractions, 

              32   45   32 * 45   1440
  3.2 * 4.5 = -- * -- = ------- = ----
              10   10    100       100

and then you can convert back, 

   1440
   ---- = 14.40
    100

If you look carefully, this simply explains _why_ the first method
works... when you count up the decimal places for both multiplicands,
you're really just counting the zeros in the denominator, which
amounts to the same thing. 

Pretty much every other way of doing it is really going to boil down
to a variation on this, though, for the simple reason that decimals
ARE fractions, whose denominators are always powers of 10, and which
happen to be written using a very compact notation.  So every rule you
can make up for figuring out where to put the decimal point is going
to come back to counting up exponents on powers of 10...

For example, I could make up a technique like 

    356.4 * 29.38 * 

  = (356.4 * 1) * (29.38 * 1)

  = (3564 * 1/10) * (2938 * 1/100)

  = (3654 * 2938) * (1/10 * 1/100)

  = ...

but it's really just the same thing in a different disguise. 

Does this help?
