Hi Bob,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Use the cosine double-angle formula to
write that as a polynomial in z=cosè, and then solve the polynomial
using your favorite technique (such as Newton's Method).

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
