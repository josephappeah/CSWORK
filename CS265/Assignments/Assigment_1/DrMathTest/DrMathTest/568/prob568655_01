Hi Nidhi,

Thanks for the question.

                    . B
                .    
            .    37 .
        .            
  A .               . 6 cm
        . 
            .       .
                .
                    . C

We want angle A.

If we split the triangle in half down a line that goes through A and 
half way between BC we get:

                    . B
                .    
            .    37 .  3cm
        .          _ 
  E .    .   .   .| .
                      D

Angle D is a right angle. This enables us to use more trigonometric 
rules. Angle E is half of angle A (it is at the same point). Angle E 
is half of angle A as the triangle is an isosceles (as AB=AC).

I don't know whether or not you know the following trigonometric 
rules. They work on a right-angled triangle with an angle x (not the 
right angle). Then 'o' is the side opposite the angle, 'a' the side 
adjacent to the angle, and 'h' the hypotenuse (the longest side; 
opposite the right angle).

          o
  sin x = -
          h

          a
  cos x = -
          h

          o
  tan x = -
          a

So using those, we can find the length of the side EB. If we let x 
represent angle B, then AB is the hypotenuse.

           a
   cos x = -
           h

           3
  cos 37 = -
           h

             3
       h = ------
           cos 37


       h = 3.75641...

Now, we have length EB and length BD, and we want angle E. Can you 
use one of the trigonometric rules to find angle E and double it to 
get angle A?

Write back if I can be of any more help - on this or anything else.
