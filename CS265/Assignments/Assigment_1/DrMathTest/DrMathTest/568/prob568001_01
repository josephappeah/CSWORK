The volume is another way to say the "space it occupies," which is 10 
cubic feet (ft^3). You don't have to calculate this one. I don't know 
where you got 13.33 lb from, or why you multiplied pounds times 
pounds. What units would this have? Square pounds, which is not the 
right units for density.

You correctly calculated the density, except that you started with 
the wrong volume. Density is mass (weight) divided by volume. What 
are the units of density? From your calculation, pounds divided by 
cubic feet, the answer will be in pounds per cubic foot (lb/ft^3).

The specific gravity of a substance is the density of the substance 
divided by the density of water. Your figure of 62.4 pounds per cubic 
foot is about right. However, you need to divide the DENSITY, not the 
WEIGHT, by 62.4 lb/ft^3. Also, be careful with your decimal point: 4 
divided by 62.4 is 0.064, not 0.0064.

I encourage you to keep the units with your numbers. They can help 
you tell if you have done a wrong calculation. They are also 
important in telling what the number means, if you ever use more than 
one unit for the same quantity. (A Mars spacecraft missed Mars 
because one subcontractor did its calculations in feet while another 
did its calculations in meters, and they didn't realize their units 
were different.)
