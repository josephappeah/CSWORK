I assume you mean that every hour if a person knows the rumour then 
that person will tell 2 other people who don't know the rumour.

We start at 1.  Then after 1 hour a total of 3 will know, then after 
another hour we have 3+6 = 9.  After another hour we have 9+18 = 27, 
and after another hour 27 + 54 = 81.

The sequence is therefore

Time   0     1     2     3     4      5     6      7

Total  1     3     9    27     81    243   729    1000

So between the 6th and 7th hour all 1000 will have heard the rumour.
