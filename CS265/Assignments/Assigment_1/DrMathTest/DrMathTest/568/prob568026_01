Hi, Michael --

You can never be sure in a problem like this what the "correct" 
answer is, because usually more than one answer is possible....

With the first 4 numbers in this sequence, it appears that the 5th 
number should be 60:

  12 24 36 48 60 ...

But the 5th number is "510" instead of 60....

So I suspect that they are simply writing "sixty" as "five tens and 
10 ones":

   12 = 1 ten  and  2 ones
   24 = 2 tens and  4 ones
   36 = 3 tens and  6 ones
   48 = 4 tens and  8 ones
  510 = 5 tens and 10 ones

So then the next numbers in the sequence would be

  612 = 6 tens and 12 ones
  714 = 7 tens and 14 ones
  816 = 8 tens and 16 ones
  ...

But again, that is only a good guess....
