Hi Farheen,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The lcm will be important, but first
think about this:  Suppose that you have a number - call it n - that
has the above property.  Then what remainders do you get if you divide
the number

  n+5

by 25, or 30, or 40?  What does that tell you about n+5?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
