Hi Drew,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The first part of your question is
what *exactly* do you mean by "more."  Because the obvious answer to
the question is that both sets are infinite.  So next you have to ask
what does "more" mean in terms of infinite sets.

For example, are there more perfect squares or more positive integers?
 You could say that there are more positive integers, because every
perfect square is a positive integer, but not every positive integer
is a perfect square.  But you could say that there are exactly the
same number, because you can pair them up one-to-one, by pairing the
integer n to the perfect square n^2.

So which is it?  The answer is that the perfect squares are a subset
of the positive integers (which is one possible meaning for "more")
but that the cardinalities of the two sets are the same (which is
another possible meaning for "more").

In the same way, the rational numbers are a subset of the real
numbers, and the cardinalities of the two sets are *NOT* the same. 
The rational numbers are neither a subset of the irrational numbers
nor the irrational numbers a subset of the rational numbers.  But the
rational numbers have a smaller cardinality than the irrationals.

The cardinality of the positive integers is sometimes denoted
aleph-naught (or aleph-null, aleph being a Hebrew letter, and the
naught or null meaning a subscript of zero) but is more commonly known
as being "countable."  It turns out that the smallest infinite set is
countable, so the set of perfect squares is countable, and the set of
all integers is countable.  In fact, it can be shown that the set of
all rational numbers is countable, but the set of irrational numbers
(or the set of real numbers) is *NOT* countable.  It is a bigger kind
of infinity.

There is much to be learned about cardinalities, and you can learn
more by searching our archives for words or phrases like "cardinality"
or "aleph" or "countable."

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
