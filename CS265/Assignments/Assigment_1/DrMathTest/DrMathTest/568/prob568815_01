Hi Victoria,

The easiest thing to do would be to convert them all to one common
representation - fractions, or percents. 

Note that a percent is just a fraction with a denominator of 100. 
That is, '75%' means _exactly_ the same thing as '75/100'.  They're
completely interchangeable.  

So you could phrase the question this way:

   Put the fractions 75/100, 7/10, 1/3, 40/100 in order
   from least to greatest. 

Would you be able to do this?  Let me know if it's still a little too
much.
