I don't think we've ever answered a question from you; it's not 
surprising if some answer we gave to someone else wouldn't be exactly 
what you need. We get questions from a lot of very different people! 
So if you don't find an answer that fits your need, just write us and 
we'll try to help.

I take it your question is "what does perpendicular mean?"

"Perpendicular" is another word for "right angles". An example of 
perpendicular lines is a horizontal line (lying down flat) and a 
vertical line (standing up straight):

One way to define it is to say that lines are perpendicular if the 
angles they make where they come together (intersect) are congruent 
(the same size). Can you see that in the picture?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
