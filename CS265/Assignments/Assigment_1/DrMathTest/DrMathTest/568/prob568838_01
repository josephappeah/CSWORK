Hi Wheeler,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The key point here is that if g(x) is
a polynomial, then the constant term is g(0).  Can you see why this is
true?  Can you use this is help you find out the constant term?

Hint:  For what x is f(x) = 0?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
