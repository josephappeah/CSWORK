Hi DS,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Unfortunately, you haven't given me
much information.  Are you saying that the cells are numbered, and you
want the x-y coordinates of the cell?  Or are you saying you have the
x-y coordinates of a point in the cell and you want to know how many
cells down and over you are?  Or something else?
