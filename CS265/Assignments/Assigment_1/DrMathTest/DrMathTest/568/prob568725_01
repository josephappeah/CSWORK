Hi Mark,

Perhaps the easiest way to think of it is as follows.  If you just
think of x as a number, without saying whether it represents
degrees or radians, then there are really two sine functions --
one where the input value is assumed to be in degrees
and another where the input is assumed to be in radians.

Let's give them different names to keep then straight:

sin(x) = sine function, where x is in radians

SIN(x) - sine function, where x is in degrees

They are related, of course:

sin(x/57.2957...) = SIN(x)

The problem you want to solve (when x is assumed to
be measured in degrees) is the limit as x->0 of

(2x + SIN(2x))/x.

I don't know how you usually solve these limits, but
l'Hopital's rule, for example, says that the limit's
the same if you take the derivatives of the numerator
and denominator, so you'll get that the limit is:

2 + (d/dx)(SIN(2x) evaluated at x=0.

2 + (d/dx)(SIN(x)) = 2 + (2/57.2957...)cos(x) and if
you evaluate this at x=0, you obtain 2 + 0.03490...

(By the way, my answer is slightly different from yours,
but I checked mine on a calculator and it seems to
be right.)
