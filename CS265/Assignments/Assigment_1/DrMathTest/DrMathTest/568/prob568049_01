Hello, Vinod --

You are given

  f(x) = x^5+10x+10

The derivative of the function is

  f'(x) = 5x^4+10

For all real x, x^4 is 0 or positive, so this derivative is always 
positive.  That means the graph is always rising; this in turn means 
the function has exactly one real root.

You can also find this result using Descartes' rule of signs.  There 
are no changes of sign in f(x), so there are no positive real roots; 
and there is only one change of sign in f(-x), so there is exactly 
one negative real root.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
