Hi Avneesh,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Why don't you choose An so that the
even terms converge to 2 (or the even terms are all equal to 2), and
choose Bn so that the odd terms converge to 3 (or equal 3), and define
the other terms so that An + Bn = 4 always?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
