Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

First, let's list all the numbers between 20 and 30:

   21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29

Of these numbers, which one has digits which sum to 10. In other
words, the sum of the digits of 21 is 2+1 = 3, so 21 is not the
correct answer. But one of the others has this property. It also has
the property of being divisible by 4.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
