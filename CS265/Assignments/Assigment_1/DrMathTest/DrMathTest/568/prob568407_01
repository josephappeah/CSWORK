I don't understand your statement that you don't have time to 
calculate using a calculator. If you don't have time for that, what 
do you have time for? An accurate calculation is too complex to do by 
hand; even an approximate method, which I will explain, is more than 
I would want to do without a calculator (or computer of some kind).

We have several formulas for distance given latitudes and longitudes 
in the Dr. Math Archives:

  Distance between two points on the earth
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51722.html

  Haversine Formula
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51879.html

If your points will not be separated any further than in your 
example, and if you don't need great precision, then the planar 
approximation will do:

  Planar Approximation
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/62720.html

Loosely speaking, "a minute is a mile." That is, a difference of 1 
minute of arc corresponds to a difference on the order of 1 mile. If 
you're using NAUTICAL miles, and the difference is 1 minute of 
latitude along the same line of longitude, this equation is very 
nearly exact. A statute mile is a bit smaller than a nautical mile, 
so a minute is a bit more than a statute mile. A minute of longitude, 
on the other hand, if you're not on the equator, corresponds to less 
than a mile -- the distance is less the closer you get to the poles 
(where the lines of longitude come together).

I'll put the planar approximation here:

  R = 3956 mi
  x = (lon2-lon1)*cos(lat1)*pi/180
  y = (lat2-lat1)*pi/180
  d = R * sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

The latitude and longitude differences are in degrees. Your example 
would be done like this:

  lat1 = 23 deg 01' 53" = (23 +  1/60 + 53/3600) deg = 23.03139 deg
  lon1 = 72 deg 34' 54" = (72 + 34/60 + 54/3600) deg = 72.58167 deg
  lat2 = 23 deg 02' 53" = (23 +  2/60 + 53/3600) deg = 23.04806 deg
  lon2 = 72 deg 35' 56" = (72 + 35/60 + 56/3600) deg = 72.59889 deg

  lat2 - lat1 = 0.01616 deg
  lon2 - lon1 = 0.01722 deg

  x = 0.01722 * cos(23.03139) * 3.14159 / 180 = 0.000276589394
  y = 0.01616 * 3.14159 / 180                 = 0.000282045207
  d = 3956 * sqrt(0.000276589394*0.000276589394 + 
                  0.000282045207*0.000282045207)
    = 1.56 miles

I can't make it any simpler than this. If you're always working close 
to the same latitude, we could just do the cosine calculation once 
and put together a formula for you. I could even rework the formula 
in terms of minutes or seconds rather than degrees, and put the 
distance in feet or meters if that is more useful. You'd still need 
to square two numbers and take the square root of their sum; I can't 
make it any simpler than that.
