Hi John,

You raise a good point, and I think basically have the answer your own
question: If we define pi to be simply the ratio of any circle's
circumference to its diameter, then in a general context we should
specify that the circle, its center, and all diametral paths
connecting a point on the circle to the center should all reside in
the same Euclidean space (a plane, in this case).

The Euclidean plane is such a typical place for the circle to live,
that often this context is only implied, as a sort of default. 

For example, if I say to you I have this circle that has a radius of
10 and I want to know its circumference, I would be much surprised if
your first reply was "is the space it resides in curved?"  But indeed,
as you point out, the question is not _entirely_ with warrant.

The point is that definitions only have meaning to the extent that
they're _given_ meaning. 

For example, I might _define_ pi to be 
             4 TIMES (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 ...) 
and now it has the value 3.14159265... regardless of any space
structures here or there.

You also raise the point that indeed a circle _can_exist_ in a
non-Euclidean space. Again, this can be attributed to our "freedom of
defining." For whatever the curvature of the metric space (or whatever
the topological structure, even) it seems natural to _call_ the family
of all points--all equidistant from some point p--a circle with center
p. Then our definition of circle is made more general, (without losing
its meaning in the more specific context of the Euclidean plane). This
sort of thing is considered positive in mathematics.

The only thing really consequential about definitions, I might add to
be safe, is that they be universally agreed upon. So in this case, the
definition that pi _is_ the ratio of the circumference of a circle to
its diameter presupposes a Euclidean plane.

Thanks for the interesting question, if you'd like to discuss this
further please feel free to write back.
