Hi Ruben,

What I said about "elegancy" was a little misleading, let me try to 
clarify by writing and explaining the proof to the intercept form of 
linear equations.

For some line l, not horizontal or vertical, the x intercept (a,0) 
and the y intercept (0,b) must exist (can you see why the x 
intercept has y coordinate 0 and why the y intercept has x 
coordinate 0?).  We have two points, so we can find an equation to 
describe this line:

      m = (b-0)/(0-a) = b/-a

We now assume some point (x,y) exists and continue, not (x,-y), 
which would make your form of the equation fully simplified.

 (1)       b/-a = (y-b)/(x-0)

 (2)      bx/-a = y - b

 (3)         bx = -ay + ab

 (4)    bx + ay = ab  <---Divide both sides by the quantity ab

 (5)  x/a + y/b = 1  

Going by this way of proof, we can see that the equation is only 
completely simplified when x and y are not negated.

You did not violate any rules by changing the equation as you did.  
It is just that the form you had the equation in isn't as 
informative as the correct intercept form.

Does this help?
