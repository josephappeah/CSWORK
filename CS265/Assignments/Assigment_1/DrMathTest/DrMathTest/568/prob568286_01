Hi Carrie.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

I assume that you mean if you have a decimal measurement, how do
you convert it to a fraction, where the fraction has some denominator
that is commonly used in tooling and machine dimensioning.  Is this 
correct?

If so, you might simply multiply your decimal by a "guess" for the
denominator.  Good choices are powers of 2, such as 16, 32, and 64.
Then if the result is near an integer, it's likely that that number
represents the numerator of the fraction.

Example:  0.594 inches = ?

          0.594 x 64 = 38.016, so we tentatively conclude that
          0.594 represents 38/64.  This fraction is not in lowest
          terms, and we can divide both numerator and denominator
          by 2:  0.594 = 19/32.  We can confirm this, if we wish,
          by dividing it out on a calculator:  19/32 = 0.59375,
          certainly close enough.  Thus, this measurement (0.594 in)
          is nineteen thirty-seconds of an inch.

I hope that this helps.  Please write back if I misunderstood your
question.
