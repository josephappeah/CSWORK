Hi Amber,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You can always write the absolute
value of a quantity of a number, |a|, without the absolute values,
if you know the sign of a.  If a >= 0, then |a| = a, and if a < 0,
then |a| = -a.

You need to break your problem into two cases.

1.  What values of x make x+6 >= 0?  If x+6 >= 0, what is the
equation when |x+6| is written without absolute value signs?  What
must x be?

2.  What values of x make x+6 < 0?  If x+6 < 0, what is the
equation when |x+6| is written without absolute value signs?  What
must x be?

Remember to check your answer against the inequality on x for each
case.  If you assumed that x > 3 in a problem, and come up with a 
solution x = 1, then x=1 is not a valid solution, since 1 is not 
greater than 3.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
