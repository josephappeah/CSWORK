Hi Carlton,

I guess you can use this reply as a guide.  Usually if you're going to
get an answer, it will arrive within a day, often within a couple of
hours.  

Having said that, note that we're mostly here because we like to
discuss math, so you'll have better luck asking questions where it's
clear that you're really interested in the answer (regardless of how
long it takes to get that answer), as opposed to where it seems like
you're just trying to get an answer so you can complete an assignment. 

Does this help?
