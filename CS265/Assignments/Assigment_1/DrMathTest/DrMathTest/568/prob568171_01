Although the figure will represent the right fraction as long as the
parts have the same area, at this level they generally use congruent
parts, for a simple reason: the students do not yet know about area,
or about geometrical rules that would let them see (let alone prove)
that two non-congruent regions have the same area. Since the authors
have no way to define what they mean by "equal parts", all we can go
by is their examples, and "common-sense" child definitions.

The reason for requiring "equal parts" to be congruent at this level
is that the parts should be _obviously_ equal, in order to make the
fraction concept as clear as possible. They are not teaching geometry,
so they want to keep the geometrical aspects simple. But that should
be a restriction placed not on the child, but on the worksheet author,
in order to avoid confusing children.

I certainly think it is a bad idea to pose problems that depend on
subtleties in the meaning of "equal", when they have not pointed out
the distinction, or given examples that show that they are not
counting non-congruent regions with the same area as "equal parts".
I'd be interested to know just what the parts are in the problem under
consideration -- how obvious is it to a child that the two regions
have the same area?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
