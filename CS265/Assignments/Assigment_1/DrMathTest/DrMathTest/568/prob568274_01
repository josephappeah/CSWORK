You can find several discussions of the sum of the interior angles of
a polygon by searching our site. Do you already know the formula or
how to derive it? Is the fact that this hexagon is concave (we usually
say "non-convex") the cause of your uncertainty, or have you seen
nothing about this concept at all yet? That will make a difference in
how I answer your question.
