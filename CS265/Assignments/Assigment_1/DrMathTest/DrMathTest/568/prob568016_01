You haven't stated the problem very clearly. Is it that you must use 
the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 plus addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and parentheses to make an expression equal to each number? There are 
lots of similar puzzles, with different restrictions (for instance, 
sometimes you can't form a number using more than one digit, like 21).

If I'm right, 26 isn't that hard: start with 24. For 30, find a 
product of a number and a sum or difference of two numbers. For 50, 
try first making 52. Those are a few helps; I can't give you 
everything. (I don't know all the answers!)
