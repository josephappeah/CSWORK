Hi Vinodr,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  If Rolle's Theorem applies, it says 
that there MUST be a point c where f'(c) = 0.  Look carefully at
the hypotheses of Rolle's Theorem.  A function for which there is no
such point c must fail to satisfy one (or more) of the hypotheses.

That will give you a hint about what type of function to look for.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
