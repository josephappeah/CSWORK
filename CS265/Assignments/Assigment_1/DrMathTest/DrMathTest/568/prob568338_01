Hi, Jeri --

What you have done is fine; the two expressions are equivalent.  But 
it is almost always considered bad form to leave a radical in the 
denominator of a fraction, so we should get rid of the "sqrt 5" in 
the denominator.

The only way to get rid of that "sqrt 5" is to multiply numerator 
and denominator of the fraction by another "sqrt 5":

              sqrt 3   (sqrt 3)(sqrt 5)   sqrt 15
  sqrt(3/5) = ------ = ---------------- = -------
              sqrt 5   (sqrt 5)(sqrt 5)      5

Some people find it easier to perform the process a bit differently -
- by making the denominator of the fraction a perfect square before 
taking the square roots of numerator and denominator:

                            sqrt 15   sqrt 15
  sqrt(3/5) = sqrt(15/25) = ------- = -------
                            sqrt 25      5

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
