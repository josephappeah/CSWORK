Hi Samantha,

You've got a good start:

  70 beats per min * 60 min per hr = (70*60) beats per hr

Basically, you just need to do the same kind of thing again, using the
fact that there are 24 hours in a day:

  (70*60) beats per hr * 24 hr per day = (70*60*24) beats per day

And if you know how many beats there are in a day, finding out how
many there are in 3 days, or a week (which is 7 days), or even a year
(which is 365 days) should be pretty straightforward, right? 

Does this help?
