Hi Krysta,

Thanks for the question.

In answer to your first question, a quadratic is any expression with 
a single variable where the highest power is 2 and there are no 
roots or recipricals. That is to say that there is at least one 
squared term, and all of the other variables aren't raised to any 
other powers (except 0 and 1).

The way to check whether you solved a quadratic correctly is to feed 
the values back in.

So for your

         2x^2 + x - 6 = 0

If we put in x = -2.99, we get:

   17.8802 - 2.99 - 6 = 0

               8.9802 = 0

We know that 8.9802 does not equal 0, so I'm afraid the answer must 
be incorrect.

There is a page explaining three methods of solving a quadratic 
equation here:

All three will work for your particular quadratic.

Does that help? 

Write back if I can be of any more help - on this or anything else.
