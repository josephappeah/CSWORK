Hi Amy,

Have you looked at our FAQ on this? 

  Permutations and combinations
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.comb.perm.html

I'm a little confused by 'with replacements' in your subject line. 
Normally we think of combinations as being selected without
replacement, e.g., 

  blue, blue, red

would not be a combination of the colors 

  blue, red, green, brown, purple, yellow

But are you including 'combinations' like that?
