Hi Madei,

When your instructor asks you to find the nth term, he wants a 
function f(n) and a rule for the function that describes the nth 
term of the sequence.  

Because this is a polynomial sequence, the next number could be 
anything depending on the degree of the polynomial describing the 
sequence.  Is it a quadratic sequence?  Try looking at the following 
link, it should help you out:
