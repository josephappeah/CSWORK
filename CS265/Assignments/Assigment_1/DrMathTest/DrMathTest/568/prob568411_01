It's not as fixed as you think. Try taking sticks of the given 
lengths and joining their ends with joints (hinges or duct tape or 
whatever) so that the angles aren't fixed. You'll find that the 
sticks can be moved around in a plane to give an infinite number of 
shapes. 

A triangle is the only polygon whose shape is determined by the 
lengths of its sides alone. That's why knowing one diagonal suffices 
to fix the shape of your quadrilateral: the diagonal creates a pair 
of triangles.
