No, that's not my solution. Try again!

Of course, if you were allowed to use parentheses, then you could 
make your solution work:

  17-16/4-(8-6)x3=7

I'm assuming you can't do that. There's a way that doesn't require 
parentheses.

By the way, the rule is not that multiplication is done before 
division; they both have the same precedence. See this page:

  Order of operations
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.order.operations.html

But that doesn't matter here.
