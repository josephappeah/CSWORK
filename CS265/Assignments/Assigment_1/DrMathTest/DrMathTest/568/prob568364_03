Hi Kent,

There's a joke I really like:  An American company subcontracted the
manufacture of a part to a Japanese company, and specified a defect
rate of 1 in 10,000.  When the order came in, it was accompanied by a
note, saying "Here are the 100,000 parts you ordered.  For your
convenience, we've packaged the defective parts separately."

It's funny, of course, because that's not how probabilities work. If
something is 99% defective, it means that if we run sets of 100 tests,
on average we'll expect to find 1 failure per set.  Sometimes we'll
find more than one.  Sometimes we won't find any.  Probability tells
us what's likely to happen, but not what _will_ happen.

If you already understood that, forgive me for emphasizing it.  A lot
of people don't understand it.

At _every_ trial, it has a 99% chance of succeeding, and a 1% chance
of failing - assuming the trials are independent (i.e., what happens
in one trial doesn't affect what happens in any of the others):

  What makes events independent?

I think perhaps the question you want to ask is this:

   If we start generating events, where each event has
   a 99% probability of success, how many events will 
   we have to generate before there is a 50% probability 
   that AT LEAST ONE of the events is a failure? 

This is something we can answer.  If we generate N events, the
probability that we will have NO failures is 0.99^N.  So we want to
know the value of N for which 

  0.99^N < 0.5

It turns out that 

  0.99^69 < 0.5 < 0.99^68    

so after 69 trials, there would be a better than 50% probability of
one failure _somewhere_ in those 69 trials. 

But still, on any given trial, the probability of success is 99%. 

Does this make sense?
