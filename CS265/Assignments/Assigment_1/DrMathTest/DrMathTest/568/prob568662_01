Hello Amy

You can look for numbers x,y,z, and w for which

x+y=24, z+w = 10, x+z=22, and y+w=12.

The matrix for this system is singular and so there's no unique solution. You can solve it 
with Gauss reduction:

x= 12 + w, y = 12 - w, z = 10 - w.

You can then take, say, w=1, which gives  x=13,y=11,z=9, and w=1.  But there are other 
solutions.
