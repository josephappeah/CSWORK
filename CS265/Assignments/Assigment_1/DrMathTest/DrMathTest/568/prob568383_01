Hi Lyss,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You are given the inequality

   -1 < (3x+7)/6 < 5  .

You need to modify it using rules of algebra until it is in the
equivalent form

   a < x < b .

That's what "expressing the answer in interval form" means.

You need to use the algebraic rules for inequalitites:

if a < b , then for any c,    a + c < b + c ;
if a < b and c > 0, then        a*c < b*c ;
if a < b and c < 0, then        a*c > b*c .

You want to get x by itself in the middle of the inequality.
The first step would be to multiply the inequality by 6.  Can you
see what the next steps would be?

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
