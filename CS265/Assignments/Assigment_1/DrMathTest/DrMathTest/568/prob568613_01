Hi David.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

Yes, you can construct a function that does this by varying 
parameters in the basic sinusoidal function to achieve what you
want.  There are many ways to do this, and I’ll demonstrate one
method below.  Strictly speaking, the resulting function is not
sinusoidal, but it does have a fundamental period T. 

We start from a simple sinusoidal function of the form below,
and let the phase phi be time-dependent so as to make the maximum 
and minimum occur when we want:

  y = A*sin[2*pi*t/T + phi(t)],               period  T = 24 hr.

Clearly, if phi is a constant, all we do is shift the graph of y 
horizontally—it is still a sine wave with a half-wavelength between
maximum and minimum and between minimum and maximum.

We know that the sine function takes on its (first) maximum when the
argument of the sine is equal to pi/2 [using radians as the angular
unit of measure, of course].  Let’s enforce this to occur at t = 
tmax = +8 hr (i.e. t/T = 1/3) by demanding that the argument [**] 
of the sine above reach pi/2 when t = tmax:

  pi/2 = 2*pi*(1/3) + phi(T/3).
  
We also enforce a similar condition on the argument at t = tmin = 
-8 hr, where we want the sine function to go thru its minimum:

  -pi/2 = 2*pi*(-1/3) + phi(-T/3).

These two equations specify the values of phi at the maximum and 
minimum:

  phi(T/3) = -pi/6
  phi(-T/3) = +pi/6

and while so far we have not required anything about the behavior 
of phi at other values of t, but we might as well choose a simple
function phi that passes through these two points, and is T-periodic:

         = +pi*(t/T+1/2)             -T/2 <= t < -T/3
  phi(t) = -pi*t/(2*T)               -T/3 <= t <= T/3
         = -(pi/6)+pi*(t/T-1/3)       T/3 <  t <= T/2

By using this expression for phi(t) in the equation for y, you will
force the maximum to occur at t = tmax = 8 hr, and the minimum to 
occur at t = tmin = -8 hr, so that the durations between min-max and
max-min are indeed imbalanced, as required.  To reverse the intervals
so that the max-min event is the longer of the two, we can simply
invert the function by multiplying it by –1:

  y = -sin[2*pi*t/T + phi(t)].

I think that this function will serve your needs.  Note that there 
are all sorts of functions phi(t) that will work, as long as they 
pass through the given points at t=T/3 and t=-T/3 and are T-periodic.

The method above is an example of “phase modulation” (PM), and is a 
technique that is exploited in communication systems.  You can also
vary other parameters in the sinusoidal wave

  y  =   A(t) sin[2*pi*f(t)*t + phi(t)].

If you let A vary with t, it is called “amplitude modulation”.  
If you vary f vary with t, it is called “frequency modulation”.  
You may have heard of these terms in the context of AM and FM 
radio.
