You've got one idea right: first find the radius of the circle, then 
double that to get the diameter.

The formula for the area of a circle, when you know the radius, is

  A = pi*r^2

where A is the area and r is the radius. You need to solve this 
equation to get the radius in terms of the known area. I'll show you 
how to do this. To evaluate the area when you know the radius, you 
first square the radius, then multiply the result by pi. To solve the 
equation, you need to do the reverse (to get back to r alone, 
starting from pi*r^2). The reverse is: first divide by pi (undoing 
the last step, which was multiplication), then take the square root 
(undoing the first step, which was squaring). Whatever you do to one 
side, you must do to the other side as well.

This will give you a formula for the radius when you know the area. 
That's what you need. Does this show you how to solve your problem?
