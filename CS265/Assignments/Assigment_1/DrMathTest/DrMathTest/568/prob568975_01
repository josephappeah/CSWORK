Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The first three minutes cost $0.75. So, that's the base cost:

   C = $0.75 + stuff

Every minute past 3 minutes cost $0.15. If a call lasts X minutes,
then (X-3) represents the minutes past 3 minutes. So, each of those
minutes costs $0.15, or:

   C = 0.15*(X - 3)

Adding these two quantities together, we get:

   C = $0.75 + $0.15(X - 3)

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
