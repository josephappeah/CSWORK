Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Assuming complete randomness: 1/365 or 0.27%.  However, that assumes
that birthdays are completely random. This is generally not the case,
especially in the case of planned births. However, the smallest
possible probability is the same as any case of two random people
sharing a birthday.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
