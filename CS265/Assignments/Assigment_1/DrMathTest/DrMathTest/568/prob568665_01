Hi Kevin,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Unfortunately, knowing the distance
and the total time can only tell you the average speed.  For the peak
(not peek) speed, you would need to take many measurements during the
run.  But I wouldn't be surprised if there were people with radar guns
measuring his speed at every moment; perhaps you could look it up.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
