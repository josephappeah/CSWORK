Hello, Brian --

The equation as you have presented it is

  2(n^-3) = 32

Given this equation, your solution is correct.  None of the answer 
choices given is anywhere near to a solution.

I suspect you have misread the problem (or perhaps the problem was 
presented incorrectly); with the answer choices given, the equation 
is probably supposed to be

  2^(n-3) = 32

The solution to this equation is, quite simply, answer "D":

  2^(n-3) = 32
  2^(n-3) = 2^5
  n-3 = 5
  n = 8
