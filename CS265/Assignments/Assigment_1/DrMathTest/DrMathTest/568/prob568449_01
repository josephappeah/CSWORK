You seem to have read only one or two pages, not everything we say
about rounding! See this page:

and especially

  Rounding Decimals: Even/Odd Issues

Mathematics is not really "a set of rules". In many cases there are
different ways to do the same thing, and even different definitions of
the same concept depending on context. In this case, since there is no
one "nearest" whole number, the definition of "round to nearest" has
to be supplemented by some arbitrary choice between the two nearest
numbers, and there are different conventions for different situations.
We usually teach the "round up on 5" rule because it is the easiest,
and is sufficient for elementary purposes. You apparently were taught
the "round to even" rule, which is most useful in statistical
applications. Both are valid.

And as you point out, there are situations where you must only round
down (to fit the refrigerator) or up (to choose a box to hold the
refrigerator, say), if you round at all. Math is not just a matter of
blindly following rules, but of choosing the appropriate rule for the
circumstances. Right?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
