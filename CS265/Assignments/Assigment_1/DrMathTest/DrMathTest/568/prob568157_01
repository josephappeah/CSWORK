Hi Lynn,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Remember that |a| is either a 
(if a >= 0) or -a (if a < 0), where |a| is the absolute value of
a.

Look at f(x) = h(|x|).  What is f(x) when x >= 0?  When x < 0?

>This function appears to be symmetric to the origin. 

If h(|x|) is symmetric to the origin, then h(|-x|) = -h(|x|).
Caompare this formula with your answers to the questions above.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
