I will just make the following comment on your Section III.

The basic problem is your equation

   x^n+(kx)^n=((c^m)-1))x^n

On dividing out by x^n you get

    1 + k^n = c^m - 1

      c^m - k^n = 2     for integer c, k, m, n

You have said that we have one solution with n=2 and m=3.  However 
Fermat's theorem requires you to PROVE that for n > 2 no solutions 
exist for all the equations  (an infinity of them).

     c^m - k^n = 1, 2, 3, 4, .........

As I see it this is no great advance on the original statement that 
there are NO solutions to  x^n + y^n = z^n   for n > 2.

Remember we are dealing with the proof of a negative and this is far 
more difficult to establish than the proof of some one fact.
