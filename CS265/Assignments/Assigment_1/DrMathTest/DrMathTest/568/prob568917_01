Hello Herminio,

I found this on the net:

millimoles per liter, a unit of measure that shows the concentration of a substance in a 
specific amount of fluid. In most of the world, except for the United States, blood glucose 
test results are reported as mmol/L. In the United States, milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) 
is used. To convert to mmol/L from mg/dL, divide mg/dL by 18. Example: 180 mg/dL ÷ 
18 = 10 mmol/L.
