Hi Taylor, 

You _could_ guess, but there are enough possible combinations that it
might take you a long, long time.  

So you'll probably want to do something a little more systematic.  One
thing you can try is to compare words that are nearly the same.  For
example, BOIL and FOIL differ by only one letter:

  B + O + I + L = 11    
  F + O + I + L = 10

What does this mean?  It means that B has to be greater than F by 1.  

This is convenient, because wherever we see a B, we can replace it by
(F+1).  Or alternatively, we can replace it by F, and subtract 1 from
the other side of the equation.  (Do you see why?)

Let's do that:

  F + O + O + K = 12    
  F + U + L + L = 19    
  F + O + I + L = 10    
  F + O + I + L = 10
  S + A + I + L = 20
  S + I + L + K = 18

We have two equations for FOIL now, so we can get rid of the second:

  F + O + O + K = 12    
  F + U + L + L = 19    
  F + O + I + L = 10
  S + A + I + L = 20
  S + I + L + K = 18

This may not seem like much progress, but we've dropped from 6
equations to 5, and eliminated a letter.  That's not bad! 

Let's look at FOIL and FOOK:

  F + O + O + K = 12    
  F + O + I + L = 10

Reasoning the same way as before, we know that O+K is 2 more than I+L.
 So anywhere we see I+L, we can replace it with O+K, and add 2 to the
other side.  

  F + O + O + K = 12    
  F + U + L + L = 19    
  F + O + O + K = 12
  S + A + O + K = 22
  S + O + K + K = 20

Now we have to FOOKs, so we can drop one:

  F + O + O + K = 12    
  F + U + L + L = 19    
  S + A + O + K = 22
  S + O + K + K = 20

Basically, this is how you solve a problem like this.  You try to
figure out what some items (or combinations of items) must be, when
expressed in terms of others; and then you make the appropriate
substitutions.  Each time you do that, you should eliminate some
equations, some letters, or both.  

Even if you run out of changes you can make this way, you'll have made
the problem smaller, and at some point it may be reasonable to try
guessing.  Once you've got the correct guesses for the smaller
problem, you can work your way back up to the larger one. 

Is this enough to get started?
