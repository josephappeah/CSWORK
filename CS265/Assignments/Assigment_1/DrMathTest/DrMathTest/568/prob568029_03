Do you have any thoughts on how to prove these things? You should 
begin, I would think, with the definition of an even function:

f(x) is an even function if, and only if, f(x) = f(-x) for all x.

Thus, in the first problem, you know

  h1(x) = h1(-x) for all x
  h2(x) = h2(-x) for all x
  h3(x) = h3(-x) for all x
  f(x) = h1(x) + h2(x) + h3(x)

and you want to prove

  f(x) = f(-x) for all x

To prove it, start by evaluating f(-x) for any x.

For the second problem, again, try evaluating f(-x) where

  f(x) = x^(2/3)
