Hi Prashant,

What do you mean when you say you 'know how to do it'?  If you're not
sure what else to do, you can simply list all the numbers between 300
and 500, 

  301, 302, 303, 304, ..., 498, 499

and try dividing each of them by 17 and 36.

Of course, you can be a little more clever than that.  For example,
since 27 and 36 are both divisible by 9, you can eliminate any numbers
that aren't also divisible by 9:

  306, 315, 324, 333, ..., 486, 495  

That's a lot fewer numbers.  There's more:  Because 36 is divisible by
4, you can eliminate all the numbers that aren't divisible by 4, which
is to say, all the odd numbers:

  306, 324, 342, ..., 468, 486

Is this enough to get started?
