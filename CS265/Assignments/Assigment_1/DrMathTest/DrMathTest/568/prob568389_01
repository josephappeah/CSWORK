Hello Rita,

Let the points A and B be 200 ft apart, on level ground, away from the pyramid.  At A is 
the 40.3 deg angle and at B is the 46.27 deg angle.  Let the point at the center of the base 
of the pyyramid be C.  Let the height be h.  Let BC be the unknown w.  Now write two 
equations, using two right triangles, in terms of h and w.  Solve these equations 
simultaneously.
