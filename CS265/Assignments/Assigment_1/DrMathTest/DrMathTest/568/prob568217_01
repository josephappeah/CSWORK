Hi,

When we make up any function, it's really a rule that tells us how to
get from an input to an output.  For example, we might make up a
function that takes a day of the week as input, and outputs the number
of letters in the name of that day.  So we have this:

  Day         Number of letters
  ---------   -----------------
  Sunday      6
  Monday      6
  Tuesday     7
  Wednesday   9
  Thursday    8
  Friday      6
  Saturday    8

In this case, the 'domain' of the function is the set of all the
inputs that we're allowed to put into the function:

  domain = { Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday }

Nothing else is a legal input.  The 'range' of the function is the set
of all the outputs that we can get out of the function:

  range = { 6, 7, 8, 9 }

Given the set of legal inputs, there's no other value that we can get
out.  (If we were allowed to put in other values, like 'Megalopolis',
we could get out other values, like 11; but the set of inputs
determines the set of outputs.)

Does this make sense? 

Now, suppose our function looks like 

  f(x) = x^2

We might ask:  Is there _any_ value of x that we can't put into this
function?  There isn't.  We can square any number, so our domain is

  domain = {x, where x is real}

But every number that we get out will be non-negative, because there's
no way to square a number and get a negative result.  So our range
looks like 

  range = {x, where x >= 0}

On the other hand, let's look at a function like 

  f(x) = sqrt(x)

Again, we can ask:  Is there any value of x that we can't put into
this function?  In fact, negative numbers won't work.  So our domain is 

  domain = {x, where x >= 0}

And our range is the same as before:

  range = {x, where x >= 0}

Note that in my initial example, with the days of the week, I
enumerated all the elements of the domain.  When creating functions
with numeric inputs, this is unusual: normally we assume that any
number can be an input, unless there is some good reason why some
numbers can't be (e.g., because they require us to divide by zero, or
take the square root of a negative number, or something like that).  

Does this help?
