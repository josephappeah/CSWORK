This is a lot like adding fractions with different denominators. Have 
you learned that? You've got to change the fractions into equivalent 
fractions with the same denominator, then you can add them. It's the 
same here: you've got to change the measurements into the same units 
before you can add them. Usually you'll want to make all the 
measurements use the smallest measure.

You will just have to learn how many cups in a quart and so on. The 
metric system is easier because all the numbers you need to learn are 
10, 100, 1000, and so on. I'm sure you have a table of conversion 
factors; if not in your textbook, a lot of dictionaries will have a 
table like this.

If you want to give me an example to work through, I'll be happy to 
do so. I'd like to see *your* work on the example too, so I can see 
if there is a particular part of the work that gives you trouble.
