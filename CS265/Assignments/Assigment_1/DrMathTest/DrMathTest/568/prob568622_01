Hi Surfsup.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  I'm not exactly sure of what
you're trying to do.  Is the lighthouse shape a hexagonal prism or
a (truncated) hexagonal pyramid?    For a prism, we get the following
angles:

     a-------b        looking down from the top
    / \     / \
   /   A---B   \      angles ABb and CBb are 120 degrees.
  /   /     \   \         (one-third of 360 degrees)
 f---F       C---c
  \   \     /   /     angles Bbc and abB are 60 degrees.
   \   E---D   /          (one-sixth of 60 degrees).
    \ /     \ /
     e-------d

If the lighthouse is part of a pyramid (with sloping, rather than
vertical sides), it is more complicated.  For a start, you can see
what's involved by looking at the following web page in in our
archives:
