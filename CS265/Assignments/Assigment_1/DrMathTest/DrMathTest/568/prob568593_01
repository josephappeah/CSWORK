Take it section by section.

Section A: 24 rows of 15 seats
Section B: 24 rows of 15 seats (if I corrected your typos right!)
Section C: 24 rows of 20 seats

Write and expression that shows the sum of these three products; the
order of operations will work with you, since you can write sums of
products without needing parentheses.

If you need more help, please write back and show me how far you got.
