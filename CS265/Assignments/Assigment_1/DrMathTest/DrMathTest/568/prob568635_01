First, I'd like you to read any parts of this that seem helpful:

  Proofs
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.proof.html

Then write back to me and tell me what ideas you have about the
problem. What facts are you given? What facts do those imply? What
might you use to prove the conclusion?

But first, check that you've copied the problem right. As written,
it's impossible for AD and BD to be perpendicular, and we know nothing
about where C is. I think you mistyped a point somewhere.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
