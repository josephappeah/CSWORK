The condition for 3 real roots of the equation

    x^3 - Px + Q = 0  is

   4P^3 - 27Q^2 > 0  

 We can wriye this  27Q^2 < 4P^3

                      Q < [4P^3/27]^(1/2)

Draw up rectangular axes with the horizontal axis representing P and 
the vertical axis Q.  Each can vary from 0 to 1, and the sample 
space is the area of the square of side 1 unit.

The graph of Q against P will look vaguely like y = x^2.

We need the area under this graph for 0 < P < 1.  This area divided 
by the area of the unit square gives the required probability of 3 
real roots.  When P = 1,  Q < 1 so the curve is entirely within the 
unit square.


                       1
  Area = (4/27)^(1/2).INT[P^(3/2).dP]
                       0

       =  0.3849 x (2/5)P^(5/2)  from 0 to 1

       =  0.3849 x 2/5

       =  0.15396

So the probability of 3 real roots of the cubic is 0.15396
