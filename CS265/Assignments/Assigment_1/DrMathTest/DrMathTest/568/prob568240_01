Hi, Sammi --

First of all -- for future reference -- we usually use the "^" 
symbol to indicate exponentiation.  So the masses in your problem are

  7.3 x 10^22
  5.96 x 10^24

As for finding the ratio of the masses to the nearest whole 
number....  This is a real world problem; the answer isn't going to 
come out exactly, to "3:1" or "57:1" or anything nice like that; it 
is going to come out to something like "37.347892:1".

So you aren't going to need to find a number which divides evenly 
into both the given numbers.  Simply divide the larger number by the 
smaller and, per the instruction to round to the nearest whole 
number, round your answer.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
