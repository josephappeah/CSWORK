Hi Shira, 

>My son is 7 years old and is having a hard time doing his math work

>how can we help him succeed without boring him to death!!?  

I guess the obvious answer would be to home school him.  Is there a
reason you can't do that? 

>He 
>doesn't seem to grasp the explanations given to him,  and that's 
>where I think he gets confused and frustrated!!  Any help is greatly 
>appreciated!!1

Is this just something that happens in math, or does it happen in
other subjects as well?

>My son gets frustrated really easily and seems ready to give up at 
>the drop of a hat!  How can I reassure him that he's doing 
>everything right without him feeling pressured?

Again, is this something that happens with math exclusively, or does
it happen with other subjects (whether 'subjects' in school, or things
he needs to learn outside of school) as well? 

Also, are there subjects that he does particularly well in?
