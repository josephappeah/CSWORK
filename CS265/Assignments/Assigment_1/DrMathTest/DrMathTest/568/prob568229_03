What do you already know about the point, and exactly what are you
trying to find our about it?  Do you want distances from some of the
edges of the rectangle/trapezoid?  Do you have coordinates of the
point relative to some other coordinate system for which you have the
coordinates of the rectangle?  You need some information to start with
or you can't find out anything.
