A parallelogram has many properties; we can choose several of them 
to use as a definition, and then prove others as theorems based on 
the definition. I prefer to define it as a quadrilateral (four-sided 
polygon) with opposite pairs of sides parallel; then the fact that a 
quadrilateral with opposite sides congruent is a parallelogram is a 
theorem. You can use either fact to prove a shape is a 
parallelogram; and nothing else is needed.

Why do you think that a parallelogram can't have a diagonal shorter 
than either side? Here's an example of one that is like that:

  +------------------------+
      \                   /    \
          \              /         \
              \         /              \
                  \    /                   \
                      +------------------------+

The diagonal is shorter than the sides.
