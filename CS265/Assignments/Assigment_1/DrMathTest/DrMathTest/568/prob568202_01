Hi Muhd,

It depends.  I think you're asking whether 22/7 is the same as pi. 
It's not.  It's just an approximation to pi.  

So you can use it to find the _approximate_ circumference of a circle,
given the diameter, radius, or area of the circle.  But it would just
be an approximation, i.e., it would be a little bit different than the
actual circumference. 

Is this what you wanted to know?
