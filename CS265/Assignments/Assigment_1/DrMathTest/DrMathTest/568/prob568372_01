Hi Sandra,

Here's an explanation of area:

  Area and Perimeter
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57652.html

Volume is similar, but in 3 dimensions instead of 2.  

'Capacity' isn't a well-defined term.  It often means the ability to
hold something, and in that sense it's sometimes used as a synonym for
volume - for example, we might say the 'capacity' of a bowl is the
volume of the _inside_ of the bowl.  

Does this help?
