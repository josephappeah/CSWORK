This doesn't become a trig question until we tip the gondola out of 
its resting position. I'll work it out in general, for any angle, 
assuming the gondola is a perfect cube, so that it is a trig problem. 
The solution is a matter of treating the base of the gondola as a 
built-in lever. Here is the figure (side view):

             *
            /    \
           /         \
          /              \
   F     /                   \
   ^    /                        *
   :   /                        /
   :  /                        /
   : /            *           /
   :/             :    N     /
   *              :    ^    / s
       \     s    :    :   /
           \      :    :  /
               \  :    : /
            theta :\   :/
------------------:----*---------------
                  :  x
                  :
                  v
                 mg

You are lifting up at the corner with force F. Gravity is pulling 
down at the center of the cube with force mg (mass times the 
acceleration of gravity). There is another force: the floor pushes up 
on the corner that is still on the ground, with "normal force" N.

If I assume that the cube is being raised slowly enough that it can 
be viewed as stationary, I can write two equations: a force equation

  mg = F + N

and a torque equation (saying that there is no torque or rotational 
force on the cube)

  F*s*cos(theta) = m*g*s*sqrt(2)/2)*cos(theta+45)

This latter equation comes from calculating the torque due to each 
force: the force times the moment arm, which is the perpendicular 
distance between the fulcrum and the line along which the force acts.

We only need the second equation if we just want to solve for F:

  F = mg*sqrt(2)/2)*cos(theta+45)/cos(theta)
    = mg*sqrt(2)/2)*(cos(theta)*cos(45)-sin(theta)*sin(45))/cos(theta)
    = mg*sqrt(2)/2)*(cos(theta)*sqrt(2)/2-sin(theta)*sqrt(2)/2)/cos
(theta)
    = mg*sqrt(2)/2)*(sqrt(2)/2)*(1-tan(theta))
    = (mg/2)(1-tan(theta))

That's it. The weight of the gondola, 6 tons, is mg. (I'm being a bit 
loose with terms, but all we need to think about is ratios, so the 
fact that tons aren't really a unit of weight but of mass doesn't 
matter.) When the gondola is still horizontal, theta = 0 and F = 
mg/2; that is, the force needed to lift a corner is half the total 
weight. The corner that acts as a fulcrum bears the other half of the 
weight. This makes sense: the center of mass is exactly between the 
fulcrum and the lift, so they bear equal loads. As you raise the 
corner, the equation tells us that the share of the load borne by the 
lift decreases, until at an angle of 45 degrees, the gondola will 
fall over on the other side unless you hold it back.
