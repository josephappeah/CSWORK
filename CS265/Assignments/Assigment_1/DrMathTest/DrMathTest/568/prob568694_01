Hi Bunny,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Good question.  The easy answer is to
look at the degrees of the numerator and denominator.  If the degree
of the numerator is n, and the degree of the denominator is d, then

  n > d:  There is a pole of order n-d at infinity.
  n < d:  There is a zero of order d-n at infinity.
  n = d:  There is no pole or zero at infinity.

This might be unsatisfying, though, and might make you think that
somebody just made this up to satisfy a theorem that wasn't true
otherwise.  But, in fact, this definition has many useful properties
that make it seem more worthwhile.  For example, if you take any
(non-constant) rational function of degree 1 (also known as a bilinear
or fractional linear transformation, or as a Moebius function - these
are all rational functions which have inverses that are rational
functions), and you compose your rational function with this one, then
you will move around the poles and zeros in a predictable way.  The
poles and zeros at infinity behave just like the others.  For example,
if you have a rational function f(z), then f(1/z) will have poles at
1/m whenever f had a pole at m, of the same order, and similarly with
zeros.  Furthermore, the poles and zeros at infinity (determined by
the degrees) will switch with those at zero.

You can also consider the limit.  Take a limit as z goes to infinity.
 If n > d, then the function will go to infinity.  If n < d, then the
function will go to zero.  If n = d, then the function will approach a
constant, which can be thought of (and often is) as the value of the
function at infinity.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
