You've started fine. Now you need to evaluate the expression

  (4/3)*pi*6^3

We replace pi with the number it stands for, too: 3.14 
(approximately).

  (4/3)*3.14*6^3

The first thing you do is work out the power: what is 6 cubed? It's 
6*6*6 = ____ (I'll let you fill in the blank).

Now all that's left is multiplications (one of the factors is a 
fraction, 4/3, so there is division too). Multiply the three numbers: 
4/3, 3.14, and ____ (the number you filled in above).

Can you do this? Show me your work, if you'd like.
