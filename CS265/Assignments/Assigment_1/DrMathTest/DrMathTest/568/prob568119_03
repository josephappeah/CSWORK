Hi Donya,

We didn't get your first message, but I got this one.

You're welcome.

You're right about getting rich on the lottery (unless
you're the person running it).  My favorite quote,
relative to lotteries is due to Fran Liebowitz, who
said something like, "I figure my chance of winning
the lottery is the same, whether I enter it or not."
