Hi Malaika,

There's no particular formula.  What you want to do is see if you can
convert what you've got into a form that will make it easier to get
what you want. 

In this case, you have

          3                                 y - 3
  a = y - -           (or did you mean  a = ----- ?)
          b                                   b

If you had an equation that looked like 

              3
  something = -
              b

it would be pretty easy to solve for b, right?  You could just
multiply both sides by b, 

  something * b = 3

and divide both sides by something, 

                      3
              b = ---------
                  something

and you'd be done.  So now you have a slightly easier question:  What
can you do to make

          3                                 
  a = y - -           
          b              

look like

              3
  something = -
              b
                     
Remember, the basic rule is that you can do anything to both sides of
an equation, so long as you don't divide by zero. 

Does this help?
