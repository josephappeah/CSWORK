Hi Tracy,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  A number is either rational or
irrational, and not both.  So your question seems nonsensical. 
Perhaps you meant:

  Are there any irrational numbers x and y so that x+y is rational?

If that's what you meant, then yes.  Can you find any?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
