Hi Maranda,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I searched Google for "dodecagon" and
the first hit was the MathWorld site at

  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dodecagon.html

with a picture of a regular dodecagon.  Will this do?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
