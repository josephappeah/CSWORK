An easy way to think of this is that 

  a - a = 0

for _any_ number.  If it's true for any number, it must be true for
negative numbers as well, right?  

Another way to think about it is to return to what we really mean by
subtraction, i.e., that it's the inverse of addition.  So if I ask you 

  12 - 8 = ?

I'm really asking you: "What would I have to ADD to 8 to end up with
12?"  In the case you cited, this is

  -5 - -5 = ?                What do I have to ADD to -5 to 
                             end up with -5?

I don't have to add anything.  So the result must be zero.

Actually, you can eliminate 24 by subtracting either equation from the
other, rather than adding the equations.

I hope so.  Let's see. 

A lot of people are confused by the whole elimination thing. 
Personally, I don't think I _really_ understood it until I became a
'math doctor', and had to start explaining it to others!

The way I understand it most simply is this.  If I have an equation, say

  this = that

then I can do the same thing to both sides of the equation without
changing the truth of the equation (so long as I don't divide by
zero).  That's pretty straightforward, right?  Okay, so I could do this:

  this + something = that + something

No problem.  But what if I know that 

  something = other 

What an assertion of equality tells me is that the two equal
quantities are interchangeable: where I can use one, I can use the
other.  So doing this

  this + something = that + other

doesn't change the truth of my original equation, right?  Well, this
is all I'm doing when I start with two equations, 

       this = that
  
  something = other

and 'add the equations',

   this + something = that + other

With a little thought, it should be clear that I can subtract as well
as add; or multiply; or divide (so long as I don't divide by zero). 

So when I have something like 

   6x - y = 3

   4x - 2y = -2

first, I'd multiply by 2 (rather than 4), since that will let me
eliminate the y's (and I always prefer to multiply by a smaller number
rather than a larger one):

  12x - 2y = 6
  
   4x - 2y = -2

Now I do my 'this minus that...' thing, to get

  (12x - 2y) - (4x - 2y) = 6 - -2

On the right, subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive:

  (12x - 2y) - (4x - 2y) = 6 + 2

  (12x - 2y) - (4x - 2y) = 8

On the left, I need to distribute the subtraction:

      12x - 2y - 4x + 2y = 8

Subtracting 2y and then adding it again is the same as doing nothing, so 

                12x - 4x = 8

                      8x = 8

                       x = 1

So that's the long way to do it.  The short way is to look at

  12x - 2y = 6
  
   4x - 2y = -2

and think:  

          12x - 4x = 8x

  -2y minus itself = 0

            6 - -2 = 6 + 2 = 8

so subtracting the second equation from the first gives

  8x = 8

Does this help at all?  Or am I still missing the source of what's
confusing you?
