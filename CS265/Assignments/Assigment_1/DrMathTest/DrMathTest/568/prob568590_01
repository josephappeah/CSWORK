Hi, Josh --

Your work is fine, and your answer is right.  It is quite likely 
that you entered the problem incorrectly on your calculator.  It is 
quite awkward entering this problem in the correct way.

For example, the opening "2 4/5" has to be entered as "2+4/5" (or, 
better yet, to avoid the need to apply order of operations rules, "2+
(4/5)".

And the "..-(-8 1/3..)" is even more difficult.  With most 
calculators, you need to enter the first "-" as a "minus" (an 
operation between two numbers) and the second "-" as a "negative" 
(an operation on a single number).  Furthermore, inside the 
parentheses, you are subtracting both the "8" and the "1/3", so you 
have to enter this as "(-8 -(1/3)...)".

The whole thing needs to be entered as

  "2 plus (4/5) minus (negative 8 minus (1/3) plus (1/2))"

This string entered on my calculator (a TI83), gives the same answer 
you got doing the problem by hand:  10.6333..., which is the decimal 
equivalent of 10 19/30.

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
