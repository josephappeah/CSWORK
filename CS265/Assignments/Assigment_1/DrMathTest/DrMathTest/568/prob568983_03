Hi Charles,

Depending on how much modular arithmetic you've already done, the
following answer might be helpful in reviewing:

  Mod, Modulus, Modular Arithmetic
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/62930.html

By the way, I should tell you that, after sending my last response, I
did get the first technique to work.  I left off at

  a(10^b) = (m-r)(m+r)

where r is either 1, 2, or 3.  Well, since the difference

  (m+r) - (m-r) = 2r

is not divisible by 5, both of those numbers can't be divisible by 5,
which means that 5^b has to divide either m-r or m+r.  But since this
is the biggest part of the left-hand side, that makes this factor
pretty big, and the other factor, which must be a divisor of

  a * 2^b,

pretty small.  Under what conditions could

  bigger factor >= 5^b

be no more than 2r (no more than 6) bigger than

  smaller factor <= a * 2^b ?
