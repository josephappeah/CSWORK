Hi Alyssa,

Take a look at 

  Finding a Percentage
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58173.html

which explains why you can answer the first question by solving the
proportion

   9    ?
  -- = ---
  15   100

To answer the second question, note that the percent she's done, plus
the percent she has left to do, must add up to 100. 

Does this help?
