Hi Igor,

>What is the floor function of .9999... ?

That would be 1.

>number is a little less than 1?

Because it's _not_ less than 1.  It's exactly equal to 1.  It's just
another way of writing 1, in the same way that 7/7 and e/e are
different ways of writing 1. 

>I think .9999... should equal 1-, showing that it approaches 1 from

What this means is that you're confusing 

  0.999999...     (where the expansion never ends)

with

  0.999...999     (where the expansion ends after a long time)

But these aren't the same.  Take a look at 

  How can .999999.... equal 1?
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55746.html

for an explanation of how they're different.

Right, infinity is a concept, not a number.  So how can 1/infinity be
assigned a sensible meaning?  It can't.

Once you understand _why_ 0.999... is the same as 1, and not 'a little
bit less', you won't be worrying about it.  :^D
