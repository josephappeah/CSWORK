Hi Susan.

Yes, they form a zig-zag:

           C---D            AB = 30
           |                BC = 30
           |                CD = 10
           |
   A-------B

But you can make a triangle:

           C---D            AB = 30
           |.  |            BC = 30
         . |   |            CD = 10
      .    |   |
   A-------B---X            ADX is a triangle.
                            AX = 30 + 10 = 40
                            DX = CB = 30
                            Angle X is a right angle.

Now you can finish, right?
