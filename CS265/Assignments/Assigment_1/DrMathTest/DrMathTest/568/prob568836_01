Hi,

When one writes ArcSin[1/3], this represents an angle whose sine is equal to 1/3.  
Similarly, ArcSin[3/4] is an angle whose sine is 3/4.  So let A, B represent these angles.  We 
have

     Sin[A] = 1/3,
     Sin[B] = 3/4,

and by the circular identity Sin[x]^2 + Cos[x]^2 = 1, we have

     Cos[A] = Sqrt[1 - (1/3)^2] = Sqrt[8]/3,
     Cos[B] = Sqrt[1 - (3/4)^2] = Sqrt[5]/4.

However, we must be careful in evaluting the cosines, because their signs will depend on 
which quadrant the angles A and B lie in.  Since we know that the sines of A and B are both 
positive, we must have

     0 < A < B < Pi.

However, for Pi/2 < T < Pi, Cos[T] < 0.  Keeping this in mind, we find that

     Cos[ArcSin[1/3] + Arcsin[3/4]] = Cos[A+B] = Cos[A]Cos[B] - Sin[A]Sin[B],

by the angle addition identity.  Substituting, we get

     (Sqrt[8]/3)(Sqrt[5]/4) - (1/3)(1/4) = (2 Sqrt[10] - 3)/12,

if both Cos[A] and Cos[B] > 0; that is, if A and B lie in the same quadrant.  Otherwise, if 
they lie in different quadrants, exactly one of Cos[A] and Cos[B] is negative, giving

     -(Sqrt[8]/3)(Sqrt[5]/4) - (1/3)(1/4) = -(2 Sqrt[10] + 3)/12.

So in fact, there are two distinct answers, because the problem did not specify any 
restrictions on how to evaluate the inverse sine.  If we use the "traditional" restriction of 
the range, e.g.,

     -Pi/2 < ArcSin[x] < Pi/2,

it follows that the answer is (2 Sqrt[10] - 3)/12.  You may verify this numerically with a 
calculator.
