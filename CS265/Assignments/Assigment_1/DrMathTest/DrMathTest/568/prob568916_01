Hi Manikant,

>an expression of form a+ib.

It's actually the sum of two components, one real and one imaginary. 
However, since we always write the real component first, we can use
ordered pair notation when it's more convenient.

Again, the ordered pair is just shorthand for the sum.  This is just
saying 

  a = a + 0i

but with fewer symbols.  

>If I consider it

That would be consistent, yes; although you're not _defining_ i by
doing this.  You're just noting that

  i = 0 + i

which translates to (0,1) in the ordered pair notation.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. 

It might help to think about what we do when we write decimals, like
1.234.  This is really shorthand for 

      2    3      4
 1 + -- + --- + ----
     10   100   1000

but it's more convenient to leave the denominators implied by the
locations of the numerators in the sequence of digits.  It means the
same thing, but it's just more convenient to write.

Using the ordered pair notation for complex numbers works the same way.

Raising something to the 1/2 power is the same as taking the square
root, so 
                 __
  (-2)^(1/2) = \/-2
                 ______
             = \/-1 * 2

                 __     _
             = \/-1 * \/2
                     _
             = i * \/2

                                                  _
In ordered pair notation, we'd write this as (0,\/2).  

>[Difficulty]

Not quite.  Try substituting them into the equation:

     (2i)^2 = -2

  2^2 * i^2 = -2

     4 * -1 = -2

         -4 = -2
                                    _          _
See the problem?  Now try it with \/2*i and -\/2*i. Those are the two
roots of the equation.

See above.  I'm not sure what it is you want to know.
