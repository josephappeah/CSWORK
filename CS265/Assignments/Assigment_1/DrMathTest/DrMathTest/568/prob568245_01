Hi Joanne,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Naturally, since this is the devil
making a deal with us, we should expect that he will get the better
end of the deal, right?

Suppose that the amount of money (in dollars) that I have on day n is

  a(n),

so that

  a(1) = 1000
  a(2) = 1800
  a(3) = 3200.

Then the devil will take 2^(n-1)*100 dollars and then double the
amount of money I have left, so that on the next day, I have

  a(n+1) = 2*(a(n) - 2^(n-1) * 100)
         = 2*a(n) - 2^n * 100.

This is called a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order
one.  You can search for "linear recurrence relation" on Google to
find several places where they describe how to solve it.  I'll
summarize the main steps for you and work it through your problem, and
you can search the Web for more details.

Basically, the "recurrence relation" means you describe a(n+1) 
in terms of previous values of a.  The "linear" means that you have 
a(n+1) as a "linear combination" (or a sum of constant multiples of) 
previous terms.  Since you only use one previous term, namely a(n), 
that makes your linear recurrence relation of the first order (which 
is the easiest case).  But actually, you have a(n+1) not as a linear 
combination of a(n) but as a linear combination plus another function.  
That's what the "non-homogeneous" means.

So first we change your equation to homogeneous by removing the extra
function,

  a'(n+1) = 2*a'(n)

which is easy to solve:

  a'(n) = 2^n * k

for any number k.  This is called the "general solution" to the
homogeneous equation.  It turns our that our extra function has
exactly that same form, and while we would normally expect the
solution to be the general solution plus something that looks like the
extra function, in this kind of problem, there is an extra factor of n
involved.  We should look for a solution of the form:

  a(n) = 2^n * k + 2^n * m * n.

So we substitute this into our recurrence relation,

  a(n+1) = 2*a(n) - 2^n * 100,

  [2^(n+1) * k + 2^(n+1) * m * (n+1)] =
             2*[2^n * k + 2^n * m * n] - 2^n * 100,

and then we simplify and decide what m has to be.  (It turns out that
k won't matter until we check the initial value a(1)=1000.  This is
normal.)  So here is how we simplify:  First we multiply everything out:

  2^n * 2k + 2^n * 2m * n + 2^n * 2m =
             2^n * 2k + 2^n * 2m * n - 2^n * 100,

Then we divide both sides of the equation by 2^n:

  2k + 2m * n + 2m = 2k + 2m * n - 100,

and then we subtract 2k + 2m * n from both sides:

  2m = -100,

which means that m = -50, and so

  a(n) = 2^n * k - 2^n * 50 * n.

Then we substitute a(1) = 1000 and see what k has to be:

  2^1 * k - 2^1 * 50 * 1 = 1000
  2k - 100 = 1000
  2k = 1100
  k = 550,

so now we conclude that

  a(n) = 2^n * 550 - 2^n * 50 * n
       = 2^n * (11 - n) * 50.

And you can check this formula for several values of n to make sure it
gives you all the right numbers.  You should be able to see clearly
that you will have no money on the 11th day, and negative after that.
 (In fact, you will have the most money on either the 9th or 10th day,
both of those equal.)  After the 11th day, the devil takes your money
(so that you have negative left) and then doubles your money (so that
you have a bigger negative) and you just fall deeper and deeper into debt.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
