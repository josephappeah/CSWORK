I'm not sure what the right answer is, actually; it's not worded
clearly. But the word "quotient" means "the result of a division"; all
that isn't clear is whether you are to divide x BY 6 or 6 by x. Most
likely they mean to divide x by 6, so that is the expression you want
to write.

Here's a hint: when you don't know what a word means, a dictionary
will usually tell you. If you don't have one in book form, try a site
like m-w.com or dictionary.com.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
