Hi Jim,

Oh, I see.  Well, now you can't put a simple formula to get h from the
volume, unfortunately.  You can do the table idea.  Alternately, you
can use any of a variety of numerical methods to get h.  For example,
if we let f(h) denote the formula that I gave you, then Newton's
Method says to start with a guess for h (you can just start with h=r),
and then to change h to

  h - f(h)/f'(h)

where f'(h) is the derivative of f(h).  Have you done calculus?  Do
you know what derivatives are?
