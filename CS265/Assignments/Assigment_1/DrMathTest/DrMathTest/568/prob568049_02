The formula you give is the discriminant for a quadratic; this is not 
a quadratic, so you can't use it.

Try using whatever calculus techniques you know to sketch a graph, 
and see if that leads you to an answer. For example, what is the 
slope (gradient) of the curve? When is it positive? negative? zero?

If you need more help, please write back and show me how far you got.
