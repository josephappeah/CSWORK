Hi TC,

You can do it in the indicated order, 

  Find union(x,y) and then find the intersection of that with z.

Or you could transform the expression to an equivalent one:

  (x U y) ^ z = (x ^ z) U (x ^ y)

and then do the intersections first.  In practice, you do it whichever
way turns out to be easiest.  

For example, if it's clear that (x ^ z) and (y ^ z) are going to be
empty, there's no point constructing the union. 

Does this help?
