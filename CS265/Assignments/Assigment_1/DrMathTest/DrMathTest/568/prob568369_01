You must have copied the expression incorrectly, because you can't
have an odd number of absolute value bars; they come in pairs. I'll
guess you meant

  |-5| - 4|3| - 2|(4 - 9)|

If so, then you want to first replace each absolute value with its
value: |-5| is 5, |3| is 3, and |4-9| is 5 (the absolute value of -5).
So you need to evaluate

  5 - 4(3) - 2(5)

Do the multiplications, then the subtractions.

But if the missing bar is somewhere other than the beginning, the
expression may mean something very different.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
