Hi Joseph,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  What does the arrow mean, in line
above?  It apparently doesn't mean "=", or you would have used that
symbol, so it isn't clear what it means.  If it isn't "=", then 
what relationship does the quantity on the right side have to the
quantity on the left side?  Given the first expression, you have 
written a second expression, using the numbers in the first expression
in a different combination, but how does that help you find the value
of the first expression?

You need to use mathematical principles.  Your idea to take the 
logarithm is good, but you can't apply it to only a part of the 
original expression.

Let y = 27.109*30^(2.651).  Then what is ln(y) (or log(y), if you
prefer common logarithms instead of natural logarithms)?  ln(y) or
log(x) will be a much simpler quantity to compute, but you will have
to use properties of the logarithm, which you have not done above. 
Then, given the logarithm of y, how do you find y?

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
