We have some FAQs and other pages related to infinity, but let's try
to keep this at a 5-year-old level.

First, infinity is not a number. It's just a word that means "without
an end" (the "fin" part is like "finish"); we use it to say that the
numbers continue without end. So really none of your questions means
anything.

But what if they did? There are some ways in which we can think of
infinity as if it were a number, though it misbehaves badly in other
ways. Let's play with the questions.

If infinity were a number, then I suppose you might say that infinity
times 2 is infinity, so infinity is even. Mathematicians don't
consider that question to make any real sense, though.

If you subtract any finite number (that is, any actual number) from
infinity, you still have infinity. Think about it this way: if I have
an infinite row of pebbles, and I take away 3000 of them, then what's
left is still an infinite row.

Think the same way about dividing by 4, and you can see that the
answer is again infinity:

  o o o o o o o o o o o ...
  o o o o o o o o o o o ...
  o o o o o o o o o o o ...
  o o o o o o o o o o o ...

We have four infinite rows of pebbles; when we divide by 4, we have
one infinite row.

Remember, I am only talking about what we would say IF we were willing
to call infinity a number. To really talk about these ideas properly,
you have to learn a bit of calculus (limits), and Wylie has a few
years to wait for that!

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
