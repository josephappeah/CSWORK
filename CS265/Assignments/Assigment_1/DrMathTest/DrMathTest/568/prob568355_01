Hi Brandy,

I think the following answer from the Dr. Math archive will tell 
you what you want to know: 

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.ag2.html

(go down to the section on the various forms of the equation of a line)

I found it by searching on these keywords:

  point slope form  (phrase)

You can find other similar answers by doing the same search at

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/mathgrepform.html

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
