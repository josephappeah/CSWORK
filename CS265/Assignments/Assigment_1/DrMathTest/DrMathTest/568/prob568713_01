Hi Linda,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  If you mean a formula like the
quadratic formula, involving square roots or other roots (also known
as "radicals"), that gives you one or all of the solutions to any
polynomial of degree 5, then the answer to your question is no.  In
fact, there are such formulas for 3rd degree and 4th degree
polynomials, though they are very complicated, as described here:

  Cubic and quartic equations
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.cubic.equations.html

But it has been proven that there are 5th degree polynomials (not all
of them, but most of them, in fact) whose solutions CANNOT be written
exactly using only integers, addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and taking radicals.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
