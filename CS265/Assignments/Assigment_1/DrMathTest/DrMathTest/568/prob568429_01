Hi Bruce,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  So basically you claim that if n is
odd, then

  n = 2p + q

for two primes p and q with

  q < 2p.

You have a variant of the famous Goldbach Conjecture.  There are
enough primes that it is almost certainly true, and yet it is in
spirit very much like Goldbach, which has never been proven.  I have
no idea if this has been conjectured before, but there have been so
many conjectures made that no one can prove that it would be hard for
anyone to say.

You might be able to prove that this implies the Goldbach Conjecture,
or is implied by it, or both (which would mean that it is equivalent
to Goldbach).

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
