Hello, 65 year old grandmother of 6th grader...!

Thanks for your question; and thanks for trying to help your 
grandchild with this problem.  This type of problem is quite a 
challenge for a 6th grader (or anybody...!).

There are many examples of problems like this in the Dr. Math 
archives.  Here in fact is a link to a page in the archives 
containing a lengthy discussion of your exact problem which I wrote 
in response to another viewer's question some time ago:

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/63981.html

Take a look at that page and then write back if you have any 
questions about the solution process for this problem.
