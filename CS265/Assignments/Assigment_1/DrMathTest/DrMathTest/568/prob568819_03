Hi, Wylie.

Some of the best questions I see are from 5-year-olds like 
you! "Easy" questions can be really hard to answer, and make us 
think more deeply than usual. In this case, I'm going to think more 
about calling infinity a number that misbehaves, rather than just a 
non-number, because that really does say something important about 
it. Mathematicians like rules, so we usually kick out bad numbers 
like infinity that don't get along with other numbers; but we also 
like bending rules and inventing new ones, and that is the kind of 
thinking that led some very smart people to invent calculus (letting 
infinity play with us, as long as we kept an eye on it).

Your question is not at all "too easy"! But I'll take your hard ones 
any time.
