Hi Tom,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You are correct that for any
positive number x, there are two numbers whose square is x.  However,
to avoid ambiguity, there is an agreement or convention that the
symbol sqrt(x) denotes the POSITIVE square root.  If we want to
indicate the negative square root, it is necessary to write
-sqrt(x), and if we want to consider both roots, +/- sqrt(x).

See  

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58266.html

and

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52627.html .

If you are solving

   x^2 = 36, 

then the solutions are x=6 and x = -6, but for your problem

>This is the final steps of the problem square root of (3x + 1) = 2 + 
>square root of (x + 1). Could x=0 be a solution since square root of 
>1 = 2 + square root of 1?

the equation is
 
   sqrt(3x+1) = 2 + sqrt(x+1) ,

and writing the problem in this form invokes the convention, so that
when x=0, the equation reads

   sqrt(1) = 2 + sqrt(1)
or
      1    = 2 + 1 

which is not true, so x=0 is not a solution of this equation.

If you have any questions, please write back and I 
will try to explain further.
