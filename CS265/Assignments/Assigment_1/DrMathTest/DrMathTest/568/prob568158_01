Hello Jessica,

Choose a distance c between the sprinklers, draw a line, place several sprinklers on the 
line, drawing circles about each sprinkler, etc.   They can't be too close because you don't 
want more than double coverage.  They can't be too far apart because the little circle 
around the sprinkler must be watered.  These ideas will give you a range of values of c.

The coverage can be considered in terms of horizontal lines through the pipe and 
perpendicular to it.  The length of the intersection of the line with a circle of spray will be 
proportional to the amount of water received along that line.

You can, with some effort, derive some formulas for amounts of water received at each 
point.
