Hi Jay,

Let's call the history books A, B, C, D, E, F, and G; and the
economics books a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h.  

First, you want to figure out how many ways you can select the books,
without respect to order.  How many ways can you choose the first
book?  There are 6 history books, so there are 6 choices.  

What about the second book?  Having chosen a book already, there are 5
remaining choices; and you can choose each of those for any of the 6
books you might have chosen.  So there are 6*5 = 30 possible ways to
choose the two history books.  

Continuing with the economics books, you have 8, 7, and 6 choices. 
Can you see how many combinations of 2 and 3 books you can have?

Next, you want to consider, having chosen 5 books, how many ways they
can be arranged.  This is a similar kind of problem.  You have 5
choices for the first spot, 4 for the second, and so on.  And you can
have this many arrangements for each of the possible combinations. 

Is this enough to get started?
