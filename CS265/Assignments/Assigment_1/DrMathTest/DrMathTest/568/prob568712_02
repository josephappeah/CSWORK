You might want to use some periods when you write, which would make it
a lot easier for others to follow what you say ;-)

I'm not quite sure what you are trying to do. For help in rounding, see

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/sets/select/dm_rounding.html

You'll have to explain to me what you mean by "greater than less
than", and what 124-320 and 342-123 have to do with whatever problem
you are doing. Try to be as complete as you can: state the problem,
tell me how you are trying to do it, and show where you had trouble.
I'll do my best to help you understand.
