Leanne,

The average A of a set of values is equal to the sum of the values T, divided by the number 
of values N.  In other words,

     Average = Total/Number,

or

     Average * Number = Total,

or

     A * N = T.

So for instance, we know the average of the students' ages is 15, but we don't know how 
many students there are.  So we have

     15N = T.

The sum of everyone's age in the room is T + 48, since the teacher is the only additional 
person not counted among the students.  But the average of everyone's age in the room is 
18, and the number of people in the room is N + 1, so

     18(N+1) = T + 48.

It follows that

     18(N+1) = 15N + 48,

or

     3N = 48 - 18 = 30,

from which we obtain N = 10.

Looking at your work, I need to point out a few things that might help you with word 
problems in general:  First, identify the quantity you are solving for.  In this case, it is the 
number of students.  Second, represent this quantity by a variable.  In my solution, I used 
the letter N.  Third, identify other quantities in the problem, and relationships between 
these and the variable to be solved for.  Finally, use algebra to find the solution of the 
resulting equation(s).

So there's something not quite correct in the equation 48 + X = 18.  The variable X can 
only mean the sum of the students' ages, because this is the only quantity that can be 
added to the teacher's age, according to the question.  But this leads to a problem because 
the left-hand side describes the total sum of everyone's ages, whereas the right-hand side 
describes the average of everyone's ages.  The right-hand side needs to be multiplied by 
the total number of people in the room, which is one more than the number of students.  
But the number of students is equal to the sum of the students' ages, which is X, divided 
by the average of their ages, which is 15.  Thus your equation should read

     48 + X = 18(1 + X/15),

the solution of which gives

     48 + X = 18 + 18X/15,
or
     30 + X = 18X/15,
or
     30 = (18/15 - 1)X
or
     30 = (3/15)X
or
     30 = X/5
or
     X = 150.

So the sum of the students' ages is 150, and dividing by their average age of 15 gives the 
number of students, which is 150/15 = 10.  In my opinion this is somewhat more 
complicated to set up and solve, as the variable X you are solving for does not represent 
the desired quantity.  In my solution, I used more than one variable, but only because I 
was using the "ANT" approach which helps to make clear the relationship between 
average, number, and total.

Indeed, if you follow the step-by-step guideline for solving word problems, you will avoid 
confusion because you will always know what the variable(s) stand for.  When you arrive at 
an answer, you will be able to check to see if it makes sense:  X = 2 is clearly meaningless 
because the sum of the students' ages cannot be 2.  Also, be careful to avoid 
miscalculations; in solving 48 + X = 18, it is obvious that X must be negative, since 48 > 
18.  But you had found X = 30, when it should be X = -30.  This should immediately alert 
you to an improper setup, since no variable in this problem should be negative, as we are 
dealing with ages.

Keep practicing--word problems are often challenging, but do become easier with 
experience.
