What would really help me figure out how to explain this to you is if
you would _show_ me how you tried to figure it out.  What steps did
you take?  What answer (I mean what number, not which multiple-choice
letter) did you get? 

But the way, note that the question isn't asking how MUCH someone
would earn, but how much MORE he would earn at $5.15 per hour instead
of at $5 per hour.
