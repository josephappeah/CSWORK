Hello Richard,

I presume the officer will walk faster, say at f m/s and the column will march at c m/s.

Let L be the length of the column.  The time required for the column to march its own 
length is L/c.  In this time the officer must complete his walk, back and forth. The officer's 
speed relative to the column when he's walking in the opposite direction will be f+c.  So, 
the time is L/(f+c).  When he's walking in the same direction his speed will be f-c and the 
time will be L/(f-c).  So,

L/c = L/(f+c) + L/(f-c)

We want f/c

Cancel the L,

1/c = 1/(f+c) + 1/(f-c)

"Clear fractions"

(f+c)(f-c) = c(f-c) + c(f+c)

f^2 - c^2 = c*f - c^2 + c*f + c^2

remove -c^2 from both sides and then divide both sides by c^2:

f^2/c^2 = 2f/c +1

You can solve this quadratic in f/c.
