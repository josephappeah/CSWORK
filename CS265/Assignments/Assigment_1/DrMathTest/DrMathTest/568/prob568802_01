I don't see any reason to work backwards in this problem. If I 
understand it correctly, it's saying that if Ms. Green paid cash for 
the car, she'd pay $15900. Instead she pays $400 each month for 5 
years. The total amount she pays is more (quite a bit more) than 
$15900, because she is paying interest (paying the car dealer or 
lender for the right to pay over time). How much more does she pay?

First calculate how much she has paid by the time she finishes paying 
for the car. Then compare this with what she would have paid if she 
had paid it all at once.
