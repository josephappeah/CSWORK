Hi Erica,

>I'm sorry Mr Maths. but I'm really stuck on this. Is 750g= 7.5kg ?

The prefix 'kilo' means 1000 of whatever it's in front of, so a
kilobyte is 1000 bytes, a kilometer is 1000 meters, and a kilogram is
1000 grams. 

So 7.5 kilograms would be 7.5 times 1000 grams, which would have to be
at least 1000 grams.  So it's not going to be equal to 750 grams.

Take a look at

Well, this is right: 0.5 kg is half a kilogram, which is half of 1000
grams, which is 500 grams.  But do you see why 7.5 kilograms would
have to be a lot more than 750 grams?
