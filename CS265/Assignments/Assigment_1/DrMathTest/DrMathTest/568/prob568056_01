Hi Mark,

One way to start thinking about negative numbers is to think of the
'-' as a shorthand for a direction, e.g., 

  3 means 3 units east, -3 means 3 units west

or

  3 means 3 units up, -3 means 3 units down

Now let's consider what happens if we add positive and negative numbers:

   3 + 3             3 units east + 3 units east 

   3 + -3            3 units east + 3 units west
  -3 +  3
 
  -3 + -3            3 units west + 3 units west

Do you see how all these would have to turn out?  How about these?

   3 + 5              

   3 + -5            
  -3 +  5
 
  -3 + -5            

Let me know if this is making sense to you so far, and then we can
move on to subtraction...
