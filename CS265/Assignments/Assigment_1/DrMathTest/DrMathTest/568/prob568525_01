Hi Tom,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You are trying to solve a system of
two linear equations in three unknowns (c1,c2,c3), and such a system 
can never have a unique solution.  In this case, if there is one
solution, then any scalar multiple of the solution vector will again
be a solution.  That's why you have one undetermined parameter (c3)
in the solution.

>I have c1 = c3(b3a1 - a3b1)/(a2b1 - b2a1)
>       c2 = c3(b3a2 - a3b2)/(a1b2 - b1a2)
>       c3 = c3

Note that the denominators in the first two equations are essentially
equal (they are negatives), so if you take c3 = a2*b1-a1*b2, you will
get the usual formula.  Since any multiple of this vector will also
be perpendicular to both a and b (the vectors), c3 can be anything.
This particular choice gives you the relationship that the magnitude 
of the cross product is equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned
by a and b.

If you have any questions, please write back and I 
will try to explain further.
