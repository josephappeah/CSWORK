Hello, Natasha --

In many problems like this, it is easier to think of the fraction 
that remains instead of the fraction that is spent.  In this 
problem, Martina each time spends 1/5 of what she has.  That means 
that each time she spends some money, she has remaining 4/5 of what 
she had before that latest purchase.  Let's analyze this problem in 
two steps.

(1) She starts with some amount and spends 1/5 of it on purchase A; 
so after purchase A she has 4/5 of it remaining.  So the amount she 
has now is 4/5 of what she started with.

(2) Having 4/5 of what she started with, she then spends 1/5 of that 
amount on purchase B, leaving her with 4/5 of that amount.  So what 
she is left with is 4/5 of the amount she had before purchase B -- 
which in turn is 4/5 of 4/5 of the amount she started with.

The "4/5 of 4/5 of..." indicates multiplication; the fraction of the 
original amount she now has remaining is therefore

  (4/5)*(4/5) = 16/25

Now, if she has 16/25 of her original amount remaining, the amount 
she spent was 9/25 of the original amount.

The amount she spent is $36; so 9/25 of the original amount is $36.  
From there, any one of a number of methods can be used to find that 
the original amount was $100.

It's always good to check an answer....  If she started with $100, 
and spent 1/5 of it; she spent $20, leaving her with $80.  And then 
if she spends 1/5 of the $80, that is $16 -- and the total spent is 
thus $20+$16=$36, which is the correct amount.  So our answer of 
$100 for the amount she started with is correct.

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
