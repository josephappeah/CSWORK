Hi Farheen,

As I understand it, two lines are concurrent if they intersect in a
single point.  So the location of that point would be their point of
concurrency. 

Two lines can intersect at one point (if they are concurrent), or at
infinitely many points (if they are identical).  So that seems to be
the reason for making the distinction. 

Does this help?
