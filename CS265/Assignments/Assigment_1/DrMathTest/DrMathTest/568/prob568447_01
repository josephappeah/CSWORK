Hi Doris, 

Let's look at a simpler problem.  Suppose there are only 5 tickets,
and I got a total of 11 dollars. 

Suppose I call the number of students tickets N.  Then the number of
student tickets is (5-N), because there are only 5 tickets.  

How much money did I collect?  Well, I got $2 for each of N tickets,
and $3 for each of (5-N) tickets.  And that adds up to $11:

  $11 = $2*N + $3*(5-N)

If I solve this for N, I'll know the number of student tickets, which
will tell me the number of non-student tickets. 

Does this make sense?  Your problem is the same, with different numbers.
