Hi Rost,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Recall that E(Q) is a
finitely-generated abelian group, so that it is isomorphic to a group
of the form

  Z^r x (Z/aZ) x (Z/bZ) x ... x (Z/yZ)

where "r" is the rank, and the rest is the torsion.  Then E(Q)/2E(Q)
is isomorphic to

  (Z/2Z)^r x (Z/2Z) x ... x (Z/2Z)

where each cyclic torsion part in the representation of E(Q)
contributes one Z/2Z factor if (and only if) the cycle length (a, b,
...) is even.  Well, you have already shown that all of those cycle
lengths ARE even, except possibly ONE (cyclic odd torsion).

Now imagine a set of generators for E(Q).  So you would have r of them
to cover the rank and then several more for each torsion cycle, which
map into

  Z^r x (Z/aZ) x (Z/bZ) x ... x (Z/yZ)

as

  (1, 0, 0, ... 0)
  (0, 1, 0, ... 0)
  (0, 0, 1, ... 0)
  ...

Well, when you reduce mod 2E(Q), then those will still map to

  (1, 0, 0, ... 0)
  (0, 1, 0, ... 0)
  (0, 0, 1, ... 0)
  ...

except that ONE of the columns disappears because the odd torsion
cycle is gone.  So you carefully choose a representative of the identity

  (0, 0, 0, ... 0)

in E(Q)/2E(Q) - that is, an element of 2E(Q) - to be a generator for
the odd cycle.

Does all of this make sense?  If you are still confused, can you help
me to understand what part is confusing?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
