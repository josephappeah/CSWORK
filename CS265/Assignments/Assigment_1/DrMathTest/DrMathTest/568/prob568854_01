Hi Confused,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  First of all, the sum of the first n
natural numbers is C(n+1,2) and not C(n,2).  Or you could say that the
sum of the first n-1 natural numbers is C(n,2).

The easiest way, or the way this is usually proven, is with
mathematical induction.  If that doesn't work for you, then you will
probably want a combinatorial proof, which means you count the same
thing in two different ways, something like this:

Suppose that are n people at a party, and everyone shakes everyone's
hand exactly once.  So how many handshakes were there in total?

Method 1:  There are C(n,2) different possible pairs of people, and
every pair had exactly one handshake between them, so there were
C(n,2) total handshakes.

Method 2:  Line up the people in order.  The first person shakes
everybody else's hand, which is n-1 handshakes, and then he sits down
and the second person (who's already shaken the first person's hand)
shakes the remaining n-2 people's hands.  And the third person shakes
another n-3 people's hands, and so on down to the last people.  So the
total number of handshakes is:

  (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 3 + 2 + 1.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
