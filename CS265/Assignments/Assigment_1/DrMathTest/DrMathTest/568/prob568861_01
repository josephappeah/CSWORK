Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

>Why is range a subset of codomain?

That is the definition.  See

   http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Codomain.html .

Sometimes we are only interested in some general property of the 
values of a function, such as the fact that f(x) is a real number, or
that g(n) is a positive integer.  It may be very difficult to 
determine the range of a function, but we may be able to specify a
codomain easily, and that might be all we need.  For example, if
you want to form a composition sqrt(g(x)), you don't need to know the
specific range of g, just that g(x) is a non-negative real number.

Did you mean that you don't know why they CANNOT be use 
interchangeably?  The range of a function is the smallest possible
codomain, but it may be difficult to determine.  The codomain can
be any set which contains the range.

The "natural domain" of a formula is understood to be any element in
the real numbers (in this case) for which the formula makes sense.
I assume the square root applies to the whole product (since your
notation is ambiguous - you need to use more parentheses to make
the problem clear).  Since you are taking a square root, and you can
only take the square root of non-negative numbers if you want a real-
valued answer (instead of a complex number), the expression inside
the radical must be non-negative, so you must solve the inequality

   (4-x^2)(1-x^2) >= 0 .

To solve polynomial inequalities like this, the usual method is to
locate the values where the polynomial on the left is 0, since these
are the only places where the polynomial can change sign.  In this
case, those points are -2,-1,1, and 2.  These four points divide
the real number line into five intervals: (-oo,-2); (-2,-1); (-1,1);
(1,2); and (2,+oo).  The polynomial must have the same sign 
throughout each interval, so you can pick a point in each interval
and evaluate the polynomial to determine its sign in that interval
(or, you can look at the factors (2+x)(2-x)(1+x)(1-x) and determine
the sign of each factor in each interval, and then determine the 
sign of the product in that interval).  

If you do that, you will find that (4-x^2)(1-x^2) has the following
signs:
           +  :  - :    +    : -  :  +    
        ------+----+----+----+----+-----
              -2   -1   0    1    2  

so the natural domain consists of three disjoint intervals.  You can
write the domain as the union of these three intervals:

  (-oo,-2] U [-1,1] U [2,+oo)   .

(Either you wrote the problem incorrectly or you were given the wrong
solution.)

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
