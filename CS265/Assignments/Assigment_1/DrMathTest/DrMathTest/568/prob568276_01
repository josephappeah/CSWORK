The way I think of it is that the larger number is on the larger side
of the symbol. So

  2 < 3

means that 2 is less than 3, since 2 is on the small side (the point).

  3 > 2

means that 3 is greater than 2, since 3 is on the larger side.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
