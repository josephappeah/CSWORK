Hi, Scott, thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math.

It's not quite clear what are you supposed to do. Is the problem to 
fill in the 8 blanks with 8 different digits to make this sentence 
true?

  _ _ * _ = _ + _ _ = _ _

I'll rewrite it with names for the blanks:

  ab * c = d + ef = gh

You're right that the requirement that ab * c is a 2-digit number 
limits the possible values of a, b, and c, but that's a good thing. 
The only possibilities we have to consider are

  c = 2, ab < 50
  c = 3, ab < 34
  c = 4, ab < 25
  c = 5, ab < 20  ==> a = 1; b = 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9
  c = 6, ab < 17  ==> a = 1; b = 2, 3, 4, or 5
  c = 7, ab < 15  ==> a = 1; b = 2, 3, or 4
  c = 8, ab < 13  ==> a = 1; b = 2
  c = 9, ab < 12  -- impossible: 10, 11 are out

That's still a lot of possibilities, though!

Another thing to notice is that, in order for e not to equal g in

  d + ef =gh

we must have a carry: thus, d + f > 9. Then g will be 1 more than e.

I don't see offhand any way you can avoid trying all the 
possibilities I started to enumerate for the multiplication. Starting 
from the bottom, where there are fewer possibilities, most 
possibilities are eliminated quickly. An example of one that remains 
possibile a bit longer than most is

  6 * 13 = 78 = 6_ + _

This fails at this point because we've duplicated the 6. That's a 
sample of the thinking you can do.
