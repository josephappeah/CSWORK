Hello Sam,

1993:    compared to the state average  (this is the base number, I think),
your companies performance was ([5.61-1.1)/1.1 ]*100 = 410%  above than the state 
average.  This is what you did.

1994:    I'd put the larger number first, but reflect that your company did worse than the 
average by saying that we were ((5.8-3.98)/5.8)*100= 31.4%  below the state average.  
This differs from your numbers, because we used different denominators.

However, when you come to average the percentage differences, you should take the 
negative signs into account.
