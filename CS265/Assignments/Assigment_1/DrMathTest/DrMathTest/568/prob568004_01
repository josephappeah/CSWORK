Hello Stephanie,

One can give formal rules for describing what the domain and range are, but I think you 
are wanting to know for specific functions what their domains and ranges are.  

There is no general procedure for doing this.  If, for most polynomials, they go off to both 
+infinity and -infinity, the range is all of R (the set of real numbers).  Othewise, one must 
do some tests.  In some cases it can be very difficult to find the range.

For the domain, the domain should be specified, as a part of giving the function.  
However, many texts just give an expression and expect you to understand that the 
domain is the set of all x for which the expression "makes  sense" or is defined.

f(x) = sqrt(x),

one expects the domain to be all x>=0.  The range is all reals bigger than or equal to 
zero.

f(x)=x^2/((x-2)(x+4)),

Here the domain is the set of all reals other than 2 and -4.  The range is harder.  Because 
the graph has vertical asmyptotes and the graph goes both up and down along them, the 
range includes at least everything sufficiently far out from the origin.

To figure out the range, let y=f(x) and try to solve for x.  You'll find

x = (-y - Sqrt[-8*y + 9*y^2])/(-1 + y)

and

x = (-y + Sqrt[-8*y + 9*y^2])/(-1 + y)

So, y=1 is out.  Otherwise, 9y^2-8y>=0, which means y(9y-8)>0.  So,

y>0 and 9y-8>0, which means y>8/9  

or

y<0 and 9y-8<0, which means y<0.

So, range is (-oo,0] union with (8/9,oo).
