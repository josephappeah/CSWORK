Hi, Liz --

You don't make it clear what you did with the "2pi" and the "60" to 
get from 151 rad/sec to 14231.4 rev/min....

I suspect you had the correct calculation in mind but entered it 
incorrectly into your calculator.  To convert rad/sec to rev/sec, 
you need to divide by (2pi); to convert rev/sec to rev/min, you need 
to multiply by 60.

So the conversion should go like this

  (151) divided by (2pi) times (60)

If you try to perform this calculation on a calculator by entering

  151/2pi*60

the answer you get is your answer of 14231.4..., which is not 
correct.  The problem is that the calculator reads this input as

  151 divided by 2 times pi times 60

You intended to divide by (2pi); however, when the calculator sees 
the "2pi" next to each other, it reads that as "2 times pi" -- so 
the calculation it performs is

  151/2*pi*60

In order to get the calculator to divide by "2pi", you need to put 
the "2pi" in parentheses:

  151/(2pi)*60

This gives the correct conversion of 1441.9... rpm.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
