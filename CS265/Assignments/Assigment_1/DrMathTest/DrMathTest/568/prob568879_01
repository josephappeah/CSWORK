Hi, Amy --

There is really only one unknown in this problem -- the total number 
of patients.  If we let x be the total number of patients, then, 
using the given percentages for the different age groups, we have

  # babies - (.10)x
  # children = (.20)x
  # teenagers = (.35)x
  # adults = (.25)x
  # seniors = (.10)x

Then, using the given information on the average number of injuries 
for each person in each age group, we have

  # injuries to babies - (.10)x(1)
  # injuries to children = (.20)x(3.5)
  # injuries to teenagers = (.35)x(8)
  # injuries to adults = (.25)x(15.5)
  # injuries to seniors = (.10)x(40)
  
Finally, we know the total number of injuries is 10,000, so

  (.10)x(1)+(.20)x(3.5)+(.35)x(8)+(.25)x(15.5)+(.10)x(40)=10,000

We can solve this equation to find x, the total number of patients; 
from there we can use the given percentages to find the number of 
people in each age group.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
