Most C compilers contain routines for doing this automatically.  For 
example, when you input a number with "0x" before it, the number is 
interpreted as a hexadecimal.  0x1D is the same as decimal 29.

printf("%x",29)

will display the number 29 as a hexadecimal = 1D

The function itoa converts a number from integer to string, and you 
get to specify the base ("radix") that's used - in your case 2, 10 
or 16.

If you are doing this for an assignment, and need to do it the long, 
hard way, then the result will be long and hard.  To convert from 
hex to binary, you can use the trick that each character of hex 
represents exactly 4 binary characters:

0000 = 0
0001 = 1
0010 = 2
0011 = 3
...
1110 = D
1111 = E

For example, if you have a 3-digit hex number, you can make it into 
a 12-digit binary number by converting one digit at a time.

To convert from hex do decimal "manually", you just do what you 
would do by hand.  For example,  "1B04" gets converted to
 
   4 
  +0 * 16
  +11 * 16*16
  +1 * 16*16*16
-------------------
  sum = 6916
