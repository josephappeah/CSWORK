Interesting. At my level, I would say that the given answer is 
correct, since I don't KNOW that the line divides the triangle into 
EXACTLY equal parts without being told where it is located. To a 
mathematician, nothing can be said without proof! It's only at an in-
between level, where you know enough to judge it to be just about 
exactly halves, but don't worry about certainty, that you would 
seriously consider the second answer as being right.

So although I think you ARE taking this a bit too seriously, by 
looking at the question from an adult perspective, as I said before 
there is something to be said for your complaint. Most likely a 
young child will not be bothered by it, but if I were writing the 
book I would prefer to avoid the risk of confusion. I do, however, 
think the geometrical illustrations are useful, and should not be 
dropped; we just have to make sure we only use congruent parts in 
examples, and only use unequal areas in examples of "non-fractions". 
In essence, we are then treating the congruent parts as discrete 
identical objects. It is not necessary to teach any details about 
area as long as these restrictions are followed.
