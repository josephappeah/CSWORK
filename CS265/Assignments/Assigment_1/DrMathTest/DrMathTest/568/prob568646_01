Hello Randy,

There's a formula for the length s of the arc cut from a circle by a central angle (vertex at 
the center of the circle) of t (in radians).  It is

s=r*t.

If the small pulley rotates through an angle of t, then s=12*t of belt will have moved.  On 
the larger pulley, the amount T of rotation will be

24*T=12*t

and so

t=2*T,

that is, the small pulley must rotate through twice the angle.  The area is not involved in 
this calculation.
