Hi Vinodr,

The statement of the problem asked for a continuous function, so your
solution must be continuous.

I don't understand what you are trying to say.  sin(x) is 
differentiable for all x.  If you restrict it to a closed interval
such as [-1,1], it is differentiable (in the usual sense) on the 
open interval (-1,1), and has one-sided derivatives at the endpoints.

It might be helpful to look at a proof of Rolle's Theorem, to see how
the point where f'(c)=0.
