What do you mean by 'combined'?  Do you mean placed side by side?  Or
can we add the areas without regard to shape?

This shouldn't be surprising.  Part of the art of making up problems
is to do it in a way that the answers have to be figured out, rather
than looked up.  :^l

Try starting with a square, and cutting it into two rectangles.  By
looking at one, what can you say with certainty about the other?  This
is just another way of asking the same question...

Does this help?
