Hi Regan,

The thing to do is approach is systematically.  Suppose I'm looking
for all the 1-letter words that I can make from those letters.  I can
just choose each letter, and check it:

 P 
 E
 A  <-- This is a word!
 N
 U
 T

What about all the two-letter words?  Now I can start from my list of
one-letter words, and try adding the other letters onto each one:

 P -> PE
      PA     <-- This is a word!
      PN
      PU
      PT 
       |
       |_____ I added every letter but 'P' here.

 E -> EP
      EA
      AN
      EU
      ET     <-- This is a word, at least to Scrabble players...
       |
       |_____ I added every letter but 'E' here.
         
 A -> ...

 N ->   \
        |
 U ->   | I'll leave these for you to fill in. 
        |
 T ->   /
  
If you do the same thing for a third letter, you'll have all the
possible combinations, without generating any twice, or missing any. 
Then you just have to go down the list and check to see which ones are
words and which aren't.

Does this help?
