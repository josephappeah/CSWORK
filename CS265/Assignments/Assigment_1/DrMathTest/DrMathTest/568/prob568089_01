Hi John,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Your above equation is a little
confusing to me, since it has theta as well as x and y.  A polar
equation has r and theta and constants.  A rectangular equation has x
and y and constants.  I recognize the form

  y = mx + c

where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.  But I'm not sure what
x, y, and p represent in your polar equation.  Maybe I could explain
it better if I knew what those variables were supposed to represent. 
Will you write back and tell me what those are?
