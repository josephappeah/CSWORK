Hi Erich,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I assume that a and b also have to be
integers.  (If not, then there are many integer values that x can
have.)  It will take a little work to prove, as Euler did, that there
is only one solution, but it's not hard to find a solution:

   4    2
  2  = 4

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
