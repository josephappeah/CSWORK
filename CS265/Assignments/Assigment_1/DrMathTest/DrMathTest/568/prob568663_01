Hi, Shabana --

Let's first think about the problem without using any formal 
algebra.  The reduction of 125 counts (from 575 to 450) represents 
half the pollution created by company C; therefore, the amount of 
pollution created by company C is twice that 125, or 250.  From 
there, the rest of the problem is easy: C creates twice as much 
pollution as B, so B produces half of 250 which is 125; then A 
produces whatever is left to make the total 575.

Using formal algebra, we have, according to the given information,

(1) A+B+C = 575
(2) C = 2B
(3) A+B+(1/2)C = 450

Exactly parallelling our informal solution above, we start by 
comparing (1) and (3) to find C:

(4) (1/2)C = 125
         C = 250

Then we use (2) and (4) to find B:

(5)  250 = 2B
     125 = B

And finally we use (1), (4), and (5) to find A:

(6) A+125+250 = 575
    A = 200

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about and of this.
