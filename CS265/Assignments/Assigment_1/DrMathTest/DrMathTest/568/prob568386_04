Hello Richard,

I've been biking.  Hope my comments aren't too late.

f^2/c^2 = 2f/c +1

Let w=f/c

w^2-2w-1 = 0

By the quadratic formula,

w = [2+sqrt(4+4)]/2 and w = [2-sqrt(4+4)]/2

These simplify to 

w=1+sqrt(2)   and w = 1 - sqrt(2).  The latter is negative and so we ignore.

Unless I've made a conceptual or calculational mistake, I think this is the answer.
