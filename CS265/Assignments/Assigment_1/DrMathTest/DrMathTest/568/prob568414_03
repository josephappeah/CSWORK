Hi Brad,

Yes, for the more general version,

  (b+e)(e-b+1)/2

you can begin with any number 'b', and end with any number 'e'.

Here b = 13, and e = 62, so the total is 

    (13 + 62)(62 - 13 + 1)/2

I've never heard of a formula like this 'just coming' to someone. 
Even Gauss had to work it out, when he discovered it at about age 10.
