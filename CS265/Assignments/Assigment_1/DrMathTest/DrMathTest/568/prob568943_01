Hi Vipul,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I'm not sure who "we" you are talking
about, but some people are more careless about cancelling factors than
they should be.  A good mathematician should always be careful.  You
can get some examples of things that can go wrong when you cancel
carelessly on our FAQ on

  False proofs, classic fallacies
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.false.proof.html

The correct answer to your question is:

  f = g  everywhere except at x = 1

or you could also say that:

  f = g  everywhere where both of them are defined.

For some applications, however, missing one point doesn't matter. 
This is most commonly true when you know that the function is not
going to be evaluated at that point, or its value at that point
doesn't matter.  For another example, in complex analysis, we
generally deal with analytic continuations anyway, so you would just
assume that f *is* defined at x = 1 despite the way you actually wrote
it out.  But sometimes the value at that special point makes a big
difference.

So the answer to your question is:  No, you cannot arbitrarily put
holes in your functions, but you can sometimes carefully put holes in
your functions (or remove them) after verifying that it doesn't change
your results.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
