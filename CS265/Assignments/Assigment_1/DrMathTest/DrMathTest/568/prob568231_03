Hello Sam,

That just changes the signs or the words that go with the numbers.  So, 

State            1993 - 1.1%
Company     1993 - 5.61%

lower is better

so the company's performance in 1993 is    100*(5.6 - 1.1)/(1.1) = 410% better.  So in 
averaging, this number would be +.  You're saying - and I think I understand your 
reasoning.  I think this is a matter of judgement as to how others will most easily 
understand your information.
