One trick that I should have mentioned is that because of the 
symmetry of this problem, the number of ways of getting a total of 
24 is the same as the number of ways of getting 4, and 23 or 5, 22 
or 6, 21 or 7, 20 or 8 will be pairs having the same number of ways 
of occurring.  So here it is easier to find the number of ways of 
getting 8 if we want the number of ways of getting 20.

 We had

 x^4(1 - x^6)^4.[1 + C(4,1)x + C(5,2)x^2 + ...+ C(19,16)x^16 + ..]

 x^4(1-4x^6 + ..).[1 + C(4,1)x + C(5,2)x^2 + C(6,3)x^3 + C(7,4)x^4

Term in x^8 is now just C(7,4) = 35

This trick becomes less useful if you are dealing with totals near 
the centre of the range, say a total of 13 or 14, but in the case of 
a total of 20 it is clearly useful.
