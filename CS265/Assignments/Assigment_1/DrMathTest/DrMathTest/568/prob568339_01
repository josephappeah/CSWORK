You know that x+x = 2x, and this can be shown using the distributive 
property and the fact that multiplying anything by 1 doesn't change 
it.

  x + x = 1x + 1x
        = (1+1)x
        = 2x

What happens when we do the same thing with x-x? 

  x - x = 1x - 1x
        = 1x + -1x
        = (1 + -1)x
        = 0x

Anything times 0 is 0, so the final answer is:

  x - x = 0

Now you can see that this makes sense. If you subtract anything from 
itself, you always get zero: 4-4=0, 12-12=0, and so on.
