Hi Ruben,

I'd like to elaborate a little on what Dr. Justin meant by 'informative'. 

If I choose some particular form for an equation, e.g., 

    y = mx + b

or

    ax + by + c = 0

then if I arrange a number of equations using that form, I can compare
the equations (and their graphs) just by comparing the parameters. 

For example, comparing m and m' from a pair of equations in
slope-intercept form, I can compare the steepness of the corresponding
lines, or judge whether they'll intersect, or determine whether
they're perpendicular, etc. 

If I start monkeying around with the signs in the form (i.e.,
interchanging signs and operations), I lose the ability to do this. 
Certainly 
 
  y = (-3)x + 4

and

  y = 3(-x) + 4

refer to the same line, but if I've become accustomed to looking at
the coefficient of the variable as the slope, I run the risk of
misreading the second one.  More to the point, if _other_ people have
become accustomed to looking at the coefficient of the variable as the
slope, I run the risk of misleading them.  

As an analogy, I can write a sentence like

  Walking back home yesterday, a tree nearly fell on my head.

and I can rely on you to figure out what I meant (i.e., it was me
walking, not the tree); or I can write the same sentence in standard
form (without the dangling participle), 

  As I was walking back home yesterday, a tree nearly fell on 
  my head.

In the latter case, I'm allowing you to make use of the rules of thumb
that you've developed over the years for being able to read quickly
and make sense of what you're reading.  When we write

   x    y
   - + -- = 1
   3   -2

instead of 

   x   -y
   - + -- = 1
   3    2
 
or

   x   y
   - - - = 1
   3   2

that's all we're doing.  We're saying: "If you recognize the form, and
want to zip right to either intercept, you can do that without having
to worry about the signs."   

Does that make sense?
