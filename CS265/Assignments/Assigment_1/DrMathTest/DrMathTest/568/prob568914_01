Hi Andrea,

Here's one way to think about it:

  0.05 = 0.050

Do you see why? 

So now you can compare 0.050 to 0.325, which you can do by recalling
that 0.050 is the same as 50/1000, and 0.325 is the same as 325/1000. 

So, is 50/1000 greater than or less than 325/1000? 

Let me know if any part of this didn't make sense, because these are
concepts that you really need to understand to move on in math without
getting completely lost.
