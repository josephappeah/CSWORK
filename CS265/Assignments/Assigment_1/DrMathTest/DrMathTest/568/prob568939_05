Hi Ron,

Count from 0 to 9999, like you learned how to do when you were young
and counting pennies: zero, one, two, three, four... you know what
comes next.  After nine (0009) is ten (0010).  After nineteen (0019)
is twenty (0020), after ninety-nine (0099) is one hundred (0100), and
so on and so forth.
