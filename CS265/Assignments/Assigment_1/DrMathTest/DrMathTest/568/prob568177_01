Hi Ann,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  The vertical scale is a logarithmic
scale instead of a linear scale.  Semilog paper usually has darker
horizontal lines which are equally spaced vertically, with uneven
vertical spacing between.  Each horizontal darker line represents a
value 10 times as large as the darker line just below it.  The
unevenly spaced lines represent the numbers 2,3,4,5,...,9.  Since
log(2) = .30103, the first line above a darker line represents twice
the value of the darker line, and it is about .3 of the spacing 
between darker lines above the darker line.  The next horzontal line
above represents 3 times the value of the lower dark line, and it
will lie .477 of the way from the lower dark line to the higher one,
and so on.

There are two advantages to semilog paper.  One is compression of 
the vertical scale.  If you have a y quantity which varies enormously
while x stays within a small range, it might take a graph a few 
inches wide and 10 feet high to plot some data using linear scales
on both axes, unless you use enormously large units for the y-axis
scale, which obscures a lot of detail.

The other, and probably more important, reason is that an exponential
relationship

   y = C 10^(kx)       (or y = C e^(kx) )

becomes a straight line, since what you are actually plotting on
the vertical scale is log(y) instead of y, although you are labeling
the heights with the y-values.  That is why the spacing is uneven.

If you have any questions, please write back and I will try to 
explain further.
