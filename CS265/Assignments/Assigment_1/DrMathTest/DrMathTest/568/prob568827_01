Hello Dian,

I presume your algebraic expression means 56 * a * b, so then its 
factors are the variables a and b plus the factors of 56, for example 
7 and 8, or you can break that down further to 7, 2, 2, 2.  Perhaps 
your original problem states the values of a and b as integers (whole 
numbers).  If so, you could break them down into more factors of 56ab.

Please contact Dr. Math if you need further help.
