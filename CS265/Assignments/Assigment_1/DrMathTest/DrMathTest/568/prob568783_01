Hi Carol,

We say GCD(a,b) = d, when d is the largest positive integer such that a = a'd, and b = b'd 
for some integers a', b'.  The number d is called the "greatest common divisor" of a and b.  
So let GCD(a,b) = 1, but suppose by contradiction that GCD(a+b,b) = x, where x > 1.  It 
follows that

     a+b = nx,
     b = b'x,

for some integers n, b'.  Hence their difference,

     a = (a+b) - b = nx - b'x = (n - b')x,

is also divisible by x.  But if x divides a and b, then this contradicts the fact that GCD(a,b) 
= 1.  Therefore, GCD(a+b,b) = 1.  The reverse argument is similar; I leave it to you to work 
through the details.
