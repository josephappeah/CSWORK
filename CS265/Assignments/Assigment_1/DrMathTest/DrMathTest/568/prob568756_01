You got it!

It might help to write it like this:

    7000
      60
     300
  +    2
  ------

Or, think of it as

  7 thousand, sixty, 3 hundred, and 2

and then put the parts in the usual order. Whatever you did, you seem
to know what you're doing.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
