Hi Jack,

Suppose we make it a little simpler.  

       10 km/hr
    Q------------>R           PQR = 90 deg
    |
    | 5 km                    From P, speed is 15 km/hr 
    |                         at angle QPR
    P           

Suppose some amount of time, t, has passed.  What will the length of
QR be?  It will be (10 km/hr * t).  What will the length of PR be?  It
will be (15 km/hr * t).  

If the ship starting from P intercepts the ship starting from Q at R,
you'll have a right triangle, PQR, such that 

  5^2 + (10t)^2 = (15t)^2

where t is measured in hours.  Solve for t, and you know how long it
will take.  You'll also know all the sides of the triangle, which
means you can use trigonometry to find the angle of pursuit.  

Does this make sense?
