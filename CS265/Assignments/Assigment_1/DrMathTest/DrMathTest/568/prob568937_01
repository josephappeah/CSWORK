Hi Tracy,

I'm not sure what you are saying.  It might help if you ended your
sentences with periods so I know where one ends and the next begins. 
The first line (x and y are both irrational numbers) seems to
contradict the second line (x is rational, now), so I'm not sure
whether the third line refers to the first or the second, or what
you're asking at all.

By the way, you should use the link in this email to continue
discussion on the same question or else some other math doctor is
likely to get the new question and not know what you're talking about.
