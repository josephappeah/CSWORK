What you are doing is multiplying two mixed numbers. Your first step 
is to change each mixed number into an improper fraction. Then you 
multiply just as you would multiply any fractions. 

You should always simplify the result if you are able to. You can 
simplify if any number in the numerator has a common factor with any 
number in the denominator. 

In your example, 8 and 4 have a common factor, 4. Therefore you can 
divide each of these numbers by 4. Then you have

  5   8   5   2
  - * - = - * -
  4   3   1   3

At this point, no number in the numerator  (5 or 2) has a common 
factor with any number in the denominator (1 or 3). Therefore you 
cannot simplify further. Just complete the multiplication of the 
numerators and the denominators:

  5   2   10
  - * - = --
  1   3    3

Even though you can't simplify further, there is still one more step. 
The fraction 10/3 is an improper fraction since 10 > 3; therefore we 
should change it to a mixed number. Divide 10 by 3; you get 3 with 1 
left over, so

  10     1
  -- = 3 -
   3     3

That's the final answer. I hope this example helps.
