Hello Neil,

I'll describe the diagram, which, when I looked at it just now, is not "broken."

Draw a circle with center O.  Draw a line from O to the circle, upward and to the right from 
O, meeting the circle at A.  Draw a tangent line to the circle from A, extending it so that it 
meets a vertical line starting from O.  Let B be the point on the vertical line where the 
tangent intersects it.   Draw a horizontal line from A, to the left.  It will meets OB at point 
C.   Let AC be r1 and angle BAC be t.  Let D be the point on the circle where the vertical 
line OB intersects the circle.  Let CD=h.

Perhaps my earlier message now makes sense.
