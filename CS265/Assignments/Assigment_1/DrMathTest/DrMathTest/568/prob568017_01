You didn't actually state what the problem is, just the data you were 
given; but from your work, I can guess that you're supposed to find 
the distance between the two given points.

You made one mistake. You're supposed to take the difference between 
the x coordinates, and the difference between 4 and -4 is not zero. 
What is it?
