Hello, Farheen --

I have been viewing the exchange between you and Doctor Ian on these 
problems.  I hope Doctor Ian won't mind if I jump in with an 
observation about the two specific problems you have presented.  
They both have a feature which greatly simplifies the solution 
process.

In your first problem, the divisors and remainders were

  divisor  remainder
  ------------------
        12   8
        15  11
        18  14
        27  23

Note that the remainders are all 4 less than the divisors.  If n is 
the number we are looking for, then the number (n+4) will leave zero 
remainder when divided by any of these divisors.  So (n+4) is a 
common multiple of 12, 15, 18, and 27.

The LCM of 12, 15, 18, and 27 is 540; all the common multiples of 
12, 15, 18, and 27 are of the form 540k for some integer k.  So all 
the numbers which leave the given remainders when divided by the 
respective divisors are of the form 540k-4 for some integer k.

In your first problem, you are supposed to find the smallest such 
number; setting k=1 we find the answer to be 540(1)-4 = 536.

In your second problem, the solution can again be greatly simplified 
in the same manner by noting that each remainder is 10 less than the 
corresponding divisor....
