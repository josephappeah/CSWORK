I take it this question is not from a text that defines the term, so 
you have to find a definition. I don't know if a dictionary would 
give this particular usage; but if we use the Search Dr. Math button 
to look for the _phrase_ "net of a", we find several examples of its 
use, including this:

  Nets in a Geometrical Sense
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55098.html

Briefly, a net is a flat layout that you can fold up (or in this case 
roll up) to make a 3-D shape.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
