Hello Wayne,

If AB is the horizontal line at the base, B is the point where the ramp begins, and C is 
vertically above A so that BC is the tilted ramp, then the angle CBA can be calculated.  I 
think this is what you are callling "pitch."

sin(CBA) = 1/12

and so

CBA is approximately 4.78 degrees.
