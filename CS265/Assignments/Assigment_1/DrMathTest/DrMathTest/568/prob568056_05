Hi Mark,

You have to start somewhere, and that's a pretty good place to start.
 Although, I had understood you to say that you were able to get the
right answers before, but just had trouble understanding _why_ they
were right.

That happens to a lot of people.  In many cases, it comes from trying
to do too many steps at once.

I'm glad we discussed it then, because that captures most of what
happens in algebra.  The rest is just learning to identify particular
situations where particular 'same things' are useful.

In my experience, classrooms don't add a lot to what's in the books,
but everyone is different.  I think what really helps in _all_
contexts is to make sure you don't go from A to B until you really,
completely understand what's going on at A.  I mean, 100%.  Anything
less than that is setting yourself up for failure later on. 

>I very much appreciate

Okay. We'll be here.  :^D

Once you get back, you might find the following advice helpful:
