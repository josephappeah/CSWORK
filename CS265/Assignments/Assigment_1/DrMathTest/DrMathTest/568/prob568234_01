Hi Aruna,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The answer to your question is no,
there is no known way to get phi(n) in polynomial time for general
(large) n.  In fact, if n is a product of two primes,

  n = p*q

then finding phi(n) is equivalent to factoring n, because if you can
find phi(n), then

  p + q = n + 1 - phi(n)
  p * q = n,

so p and q are, respectively,

  n + 1 - phi(n) + sqrt((n + 1 - phi(n))^2 - 4n)
  ----------------------------------------------
                        2

and

  n + 1 - phi(n) - sqrt((n + 1 - phi(n))^2 - 4n)
  ----------------------------------------------.
                        2

And those two expressions are very easy to calculate.  So if you could
compute phi(n) in polynomial time, then you could factor n in
polynomial time, and it is conjectured (but not yet proven) that it is
impossible to factor n in polynomial time.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
