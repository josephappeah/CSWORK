Hello again, Tam Lam --

If the function were

    3          3
  ----- = ----------
  x^2-4   (x+2)(x-2)

Then the domain would not include the values x=-2 or x=2, because 
either one of them will make the denominator zero, which is not 
allowed.

But your function is

    3
  -----
  x^2+4

"x^2" is always 0 or positive, so x^2+4 is always positive (for real 
numbers); thus there are no real values of x for which the 
denominator is zero.
