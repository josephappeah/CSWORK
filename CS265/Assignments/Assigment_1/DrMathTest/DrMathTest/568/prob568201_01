Pick's Theorem states that the area of a simple lattice polygon P
is given by  I + B/2 - 1, where I is the number of lattice points
in the Interior of P and B is the number of lattice points on the
Boundary of P.

To help remember the correct formula, you can check it on easy
cases (unit square, small rectangles, etc) or, better, you can
view how it arises from additivity of area. One can view Pick's
formula as weighting each interior point by 1, and each boundary 
point by 1/2, except that two boundary points are omitted. Now
suppose we are adjoining two polygons along an edge as in the
diagram below. Let's check that Pick's formula gives the same
result for the union as it does for the sum of the parts (and
thus it gives an additive formula for area, as required).

           1/2           1/2                    1/2   1/2
      ... - @             @ - ...          ... - @     @ - ...
    /         \         /         \      /         \ /         \
             0 @       @ 0                          @ 0 
               |       |                            
   .       1/2 @       @ 1/2       .    .           @ 1         . 
   .           |   +   |           .  = .                       . 
   .       1/2 @       @ 1/2       .    .           @ 1         .
               |       |                            
             0 @       @ 0                          @ 0 
    \         /         \         /      \         / \         /
      ... - @             @ - ...          ... - @     @ - ...
           1/2           1/2                    1/2   1/2

The edge endpoints we choose as the two omitted boundary points.
The inside points on the edge were each weighted 1/2 + 1/2 on the 
left, but are weighted 1 on the right since they become interior.
All other points stay interior or stay boundary points, so their
weight remains the same on both sides. So Pick's formula is additive.

Let the rectangle have length x and width y.  The area is clearly 
length times width:

     area = xy

The rectangle with length x and width y has (x+1) lattice points 
along each of the two sides of length x and (y+1) lattice points 
along each of the two sides of length y.  The total number of 
lattice points on the rectangle, counting the lattice points in the 
corner only once each, is

     lattice points on rectangle = 2x+2y

The lattice points inside the rectangle form a rectangular array of 
length (x-2) and width (y-2); the number of lattice points in this 
rectangular array is

     lattice points inside rectangle = (x-1)(y-1) = xy-x-y+1

We want to express the area "xy" as a function of the number of 
lattice points on the rectangle, "2x+2y", and the number of lattice 
points inside the rectangle, "xy-x-y+1".

The expression we want, "xy", is part of the expression for the 
number of lattice points inside the rectangle "xy-x-y+1".  What do 
we have to do to the expression "xy-x-y+1" to get to the desired 
expression "xy"?  We need to add "x+y" and subtract "1".  But "x+y" 
is just half of "2x+2y", which is the number of lattice points on 
the rectangle.

So we have

     xy = (xy-x-y+1) + (x+y) - 1
     xy = (xy-x-y+1) + (1/2)(2x+2y) -1

Replacing the expressions "xy", "xy-x-y+1", and "2x+2y" with the 
words represented by those expressions, we have the answer to our 
problem:

area of rectangle 
 =  (number of lattice points inside rectangle)
 + (1/2 no. of lattice points on perimeter of the rectangle) - 1
