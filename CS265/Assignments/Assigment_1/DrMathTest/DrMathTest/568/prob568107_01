I think you just want to find out how many pairs of letters there are in
the set A ... G.  There are 7 letters that you can choose for the first
one, but once you've picked the first letter, there are only 6
possibilities for the second, so there are 7x6 = 42 two-letter
combinations.

But you also said that AG and GA, for example, are the same.  Notice
that in your set of 42 pairs, every time you have two letters in one
order, they will also appear in the other, so each combination is
counted twice, giving 42/2 = 21 pairs.

Let me show you what's going on by listing all the pairs for a
simpler problem: 5 points: A, B, C, D, E.

Here are the pairs:

AB BA
AC CA
AD DA
AE EA
BC CB
BD DB
BE EB
CD DC
CE EC
DE ED

There are 20 pairs as we expect (5 ways to choose the first, and
after it's picked, 4 ways to choose the next, for a total of 5x4 = 20
pairs).

But notice how I've arranged them above: each pair is listed twice
-- in one order and then in the reverse order, so you've really
only got 10 pairs if you consider AB = BA, AC = CA, and so on.
