Hi, Tam Lam --

You aren't being asked to express a function using absolute value -- 
you are being asked to express the domain of a function using 
absolute value.

One useful way to read the inequality

  |x-5|<2

is

  "the set of numbers for which the difference between the number
   and 5 is less than 2"

And this can be read as

  "the set of numbers less than 2 away from 5"

Interpreted this way, it is easy to see that

  |x-5|<2 = "numbers less than 2 away from 5" =  "3<x<7"

In your problem, you are given the domain and asked to express that 
domain using absolute values.  So let's see how, in the preceding 
example, we take the given domain

  "3<x<7"

and convert it to

  "|x-5|<2"

To do this, we find the midpoint of the domain; for the given 
domain "3<x<7", the midpoint is x=5.  Then we see that each endpoint 
of the domain is 2 units from that midpoint, so the domain "3<x<7" 
is the set of all numbers less than 2 units from 5.

And using the interpretation described above, the "set of all 
numbers less than 2 units from 5" is expressed by the absolute value 
inequality

  |x-5|<2

So to find the answer to your question, you just need to convert the 
given domain "-3<x<5" to an absolute value inequality using the 
method shown just above.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
