Hi, Abi --

A number to the n-th power means that number multiplied by itself n 
times.

In printed text, the power is shown as a small number to the right 
of and raised above the other number.  In typed text, we can crudely 
represent it as

    2
   5

This can get very confusing, however; in typed text we usually use 
the "^" symbol to indicate raising to a power.

So 5 to the 2nd power is 5 multiplied by itself 2 times:

    2
   5  = 5^2 = 5*5 = 25

And 5 to the 5th power would be 5 multiplied by itself 5 times:

    5
   5  = 5^5 = 5*5*5*5*5 = 3125

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any more questions 
about this.
