By multiplying by 3, you are counting only the NEW members each 
month, not ALL the members at that time.

After one month, there are 1 + 1*3 = 1*4 = 4 members, 3 of them new.

After the second month, each has found 3 more in addition to 
him/herself, making 4 + 4*3 = 4*4 members in all.

And so on: each month multiplies the total by 4, making 4^6 = 2^12 = 
4096 after 6 months.

I wonder why the teacher didn't explain the reasoning.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
