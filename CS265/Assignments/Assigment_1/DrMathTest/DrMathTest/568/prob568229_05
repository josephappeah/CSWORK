It's not clear, but let me describe what I think you might have said,
and you can tell me what you meant to say:

I think you said that you know that the bottom-left corner of your
rectangle is at a certain point, such as

  (17, 26)

and you have another point inside the rectangle such as

  (19, 29)

and you want to know what the coordinates would be if you moved the
origin (0, 0) to the bottom-left corner of the rectangle, so that your
point was now

  (19-17, 29-26) = (2, 3).

Is that the idea?  A simple translation or "sliding"?  Then you just
subtract.
