Hello Chao,

Implicit differentiation.  Imagine that y is a function of x, even if you don't know it, 
explicitly. Differentiate with respect to x.

0 - 1*y - x*y' = 1 - y'

Solve this for y'.

Afterwards, differentiate both sides with respect to x.  Ocassionally, you'll come to a y'.  
You can replace y' by the result you found above.
