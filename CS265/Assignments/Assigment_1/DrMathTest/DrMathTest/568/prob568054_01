No, there's no standard method for solving these puzzles; you just 
have to use a lot of trial and error, plus some number sense. For 
example, to get a whole number you have to divide by something that 
is a factor of the dividend. It may also help to remind yourself of 
the order of operations by inserting parentheses to force everything 
to be done in the right order:

  _ - _ + ((_ x _) / _) - _ = 11
  a   b     c   d    e    f

Or you might rearrange the expression in your mind, noting that two 
numbers are subtracted, so it's as if you had

  [_ + ((_ x _) / _)] - [_ + _] = 11
   a     c   d    e      b   f

But if that isn't clear to you, don't try it -- just do whatever 
makes sense to you, and as you play with the puzzle you may start to 
get more ideas about how it works.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
