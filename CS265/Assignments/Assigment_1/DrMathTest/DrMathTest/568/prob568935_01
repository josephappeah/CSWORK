Hello Stine,

Are these two-crust pies or just one crust?  The recipe you gave above sounds like enough 
for one 9 inch crust.  I'll assume this. You want to make a 11 inch crust.

OK, for a 9 inch crust, one needs a circle of rolled dough with a radius of 9+1.5 inches.  
The thickness will be the same for both 9 and 11 inch crusts; call it h.  The volume of 
dough for the 9 inch crust will be pi*10.5^2*h.  For the 11 inch crust it will be
pi*12.5^2*h.

The ratio of these two volumes (each is the volume of a (thin) cylinder) is

pi*12.5^2*h/[pi*10.5^2*h] = 12.5^2/10.5^2 = 1.41

So, if I were doing this, I'd make 1.5 times the given recipe.

So, 1.5 c of flour instead of 1, etc.
