Hello Judy,

If you read through the brief comments at

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsPostulates.html

you will find references to non-Euclidean geometries and to works by Janos Bolyai  and 
Nicolai Lobachevsky.  The existence of these geometries provided much material for 
speculation for quite a long time.

And you might want to consult a full-fledged history of mathematics text for a full 
discussion of this topic.
