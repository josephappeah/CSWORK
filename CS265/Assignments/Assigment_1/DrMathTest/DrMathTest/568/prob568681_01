Hi Dan,

A 'bunch'?  :^l

That group size doesn't come up enough to have a common name of its
own.  However, according to 

  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.polygon.names.html

the relevant prefix would be 'octadeca', so you could call it an
'octadectet', and anyone else would be hard pressed to explain why
you'd be wrong...

Does this help?
