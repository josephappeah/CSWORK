Hi Kaitlyn,

If the lot has 3600 square feet, then

  length * width = 3600

but we know the width is 8 ft, so 

     length * 80 = 3600

Can you figure out what length would make this true?  

Once you know the length and width, you can add up the lengths of the
sides of the lot to get the perimeter.  

Does this make sense?  If not, you might want to take a look at

  Area and Perimeter

Does this help?
