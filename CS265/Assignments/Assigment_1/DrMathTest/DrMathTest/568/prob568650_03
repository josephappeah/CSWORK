Hi,

The first thing that occurs to me is that if I want

  b^2 - 4ac

to be a perfect square, I'd set it equal to a perfect square,

  b^2 - 4ac = k^2

and see where that takes me.  rearranging a little, 

  b^2 - k^2 = 4ac

Do we know anything about differences of squares?  In fact, a
difference of squares is a common pattern in algebra, so I can factor it:

  (b + k)(b - k) = 4ac

Suppose I just pick values for b and k, e.g., b=3 and k=1.  Then

  (3 + 1)(3 - 1) = 4ac

               8 = 4ac

               2 = ac

This determines which values of a and c will work:

  (b,k,a,b) =    (3,1,1,2)

              or (3,1,2,1)

Does this work for _any_ values of b and k, so long as k is less than
b?  How about 3 and 2?  

  (3 + 2)(3 - 2) = 4ac

               5 = 4ac

Nope, that's not going to work.  Clearly, the first requirement is
going to be that the difference of squares has to be even.  Which
means that b and k have to be both odd, or both even. 

There are going to be a _lot_ of ways to choose b and k that will let
you choose a and c:

  (5 + 1)(5 - 1) = 6 * 4 = 4ac              a, c are factors of 6

  (5 + 3)(5 - 3) = 8 * 2 = 4ac              a, c are factors of 4

  (7 + 1)(7 - 1) = 8 * 6 = 4ac              a, c are factors of 12

  (7 + 3)(7 - 3) = ...

Which makes me wonder if I'm still not understanding the problem
you're trying to solve.  For example, I don't know where 'if x = 10'
fits into any of this, since the value of the variable (x) has no
bearing on the value of the discriminant...
