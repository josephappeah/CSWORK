Hi Josh,

I think you mean 

      k - 2
  m = -----
        t

right?  If so, that's correct.  Nicely done!

Note that you'd have to write it as 

  m = (k - 2)/t

to indicate that you're dividing _everything_ on both sides by t. 

It makes a difference, because by convention we do multiplications and
divisions before additions and subtractions, so 

  k - 2/t

would be interpreted as 

  k - (2/t)

If you're not familiar with this convention, see

Does this help?
