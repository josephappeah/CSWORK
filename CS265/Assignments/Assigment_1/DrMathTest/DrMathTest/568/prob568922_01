Hi Jim,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  If you don't want to know where this
formula comes from, then the volume of liquid in a cylindrical tank
lying on the curved side is:

        1     2                      2     2          h
  w * [ -*pi*r  + (h-r)*sqrt( 2rh - h ) + r * arcsin( - - 1 ) ]
        2                                             r

where r is the radius of the circular ends of the tank (half the
diameter, so r = 48 inches), w is the length of the tank (so w = 132
inches), and h is the height of the water (h=0 for empty, h=2*r for
full, h=r for half full).

Then convert from cubic inches to gallons by multiplying by

  0.00432900432900433 gallons / cubic inch

(read the "/" as "per"), which is exactly

  1/231 of a gallon per cubic inch.

In other words, instead of multiplying you can divide by

  231 cubic inches / gallon.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
