Hello, Md. Shamsul Alam --

The quick answer is as follows:

If a and b are relatively prime, then the largest number which 
cannot be made using a linear combination of a and b is the number

  (ab) - (a+b)

For your example with a=4 and b=3, this formula gives the largest 
number as 12-7=5, which you know is the correct result.

I have seen, somewhere in the Dr. Math archives, a response to a 
similar question in which the above formula is proved -- but I 
couldn't find it just now when I searched for it....
