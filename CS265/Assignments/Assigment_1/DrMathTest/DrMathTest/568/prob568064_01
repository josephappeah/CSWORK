Hi Cleo,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I think that the equation you want is

  P(E, F, or G) = P(E) + P(F) + P(G)
                  - P(E & F) - P(F & G) - P(E & G) + P(E, F, & G)

Otherwise, your math looks good.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
