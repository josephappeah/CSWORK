Hi Nancy,

Actually, there _is_ only one reason, and that's because we've
_chosen_ to define prime numbers that way.  We could define prime
numbers to include 1.  (For that matter, we could define primes to
include negative numbers.)  Expanding the definition would make the
wording of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic a little clunkier
than it is now, and that would mean that we'd have add extra wording
to many of the theorems of number theory, but apart from that, we're
free to choose whatever definition of 'prime' we like best.  

Teachers are fond of making up lists of things like 'the three reasons
why 1 is not prime', or 'the four steps to solving a problem', or 'the
five basic algebraic manipulations', and so on.  But these are just
lists in their heads.  They have no bearing on what's actually
happening out in the world.  

Does this help?
