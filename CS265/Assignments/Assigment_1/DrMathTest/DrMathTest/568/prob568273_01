You should draw out a reasonable number of diagrams so that you can 
see 
what patterns develop.

Let n = number of rows of little triangles

If you draw the figure for n=1 to 6, i.e. up to six little triangles 
along an edge of the large triangle it soon becomes apparent that 
for triangles the right way up (point at 
the top), the total number of triangles is given by the sum

 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15 + 21 +..... + n(n+1)/2

Then for the upside down triangles the series goes differently 
depending on whether n is odd or even.

If n is even the series is

  1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + .....+ k(2k-1)   for k=1 to k=n/2

If n is odd the series is

  3 + 10 + 21 + 36 + ... + k(2k+1)  for k=1 to k=(n-1)/2

You will notice that these two series are obtained from the series 
at the top by taking alternate terms.

So the complete results are

Number of triangles with n even

  SUM(r=1 to n)[r(r+1)/2]  +  SUM(r=1 to n/2)[r(2r-1)]

Number of triangles when n is odd

  SUM(r=1 to n)[r(r+1)/2]  +  SUM(r=1 to (n-1)/2)[r(2r+1)]

If we carry out the summations we get the following formulae

When n is even:

Total number of triangles  = n(n+2)(2n+1)/8

When n is odd:

Total number of triangles is = (n+1)(2n^2+3n-1)/8

For example with n=3 (3 rows of little triangles)

 Total number of triangles = (n+1)(2n^2+3n-1)/8

                           = 4 x (18 + 9 - 1)/8

                           = 4 x 26/8

                           =  13  (correct)

With n=2 (2 rows of little triangles)

  Total number of triangles = n(n+2)(2n+1)/8

                            = 2 x 4 x 5/8

                            =  5   (correct)
