Hi Bill,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  If you are just talking about 
computing integrals

   /
   |f(x)dx
   /

and adding an arbitrary constant to the formula with the variable,
as in

   /
   | cos(x)dx = sin(x) + C ,
   /

then there is no reason to add a second constant, since the sum of
two arbitrary constants is itself just one constant.

If F1(x) and F2(x) are both antiderivatives of f(x), so that

   /                         /
   |f(x)dx = F1(x)     and   | f(x)dx = F2(x) ,
   /                         /

then

   F1'(x) = f(x)   and  F2'(x) = f(x), 

so

   (F1-F2)'(x) = 0 ,

so that the function (F1-F2)(x) = F1(x) - F2(x) must be a constant 
(by the Mean Value Theorem). 

If you integrate a function twice, then you would need two arbitrary
constants.  For example, if we integrate cos(x) a second time, we
would have

   /
   | (sin(x) + C) dx = -cos(x) + Cx + C2
   /

and now you need the second constant.

Does this answer your question?

If you have any questions, please write back and I 
will try to explain further.
