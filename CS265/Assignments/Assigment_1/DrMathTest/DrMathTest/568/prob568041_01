Let's take it more slowly. To help you, I have to know what help you 
need, and that means I have to see your thinking, not just the 
problem. Please choose one of these, and show me what ideas you have 
about it, even if you are nowhere near a solution. Since you are 
learning algebra, the first step will be to identify a variable or 
two. Write a definition of a variable, and then try to write an 
equation. In fact, don't go that far: just write an expression 
corresponding to each phrase in the problem, and I'll help you put 
those together into an equation.

I'll demonstrate with the first:

>a.) You have borrowed $529 from your parents to buy a montain bike.  
>Your parents are not charging you interest, but they want to be 
>repaid as soon as possible.  You can afford to repay them $20 per 
>week.  How long will it take you to repay your parents?


What number don't we know? The time to repay. So let's define a 
variable:

  T = time to repay the loan, in weeks

(I find it important to define the variable this way, including the 
units.)

Now suppose we knew this number. How could we use it? Well, paying 
$20 per week for T weeks, how much will we have paid? Write an 
expression for that amount. Then, how is that related to the $529? 
Can you write an equation?
