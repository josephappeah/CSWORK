Hi, Alex --

A hexagon is a two-dimensional figure; it has area but no volume.  
Are you talking about the area of a hexagon, or about the volume of 
a hexagonal prism (a 3-dimensional figure with a hexagonal cross 
section)?  Or do you have something else in mind?  In addition, you 
need to tell whether the hexagon you have in mind is a regular 
hexagon (all sides the same length and all angles the same.

We will be happy to try to answer your question if you provide a 
sufficient description of your figure....
