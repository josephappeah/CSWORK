Since this is a multiple choice problem, one way to solve it would be
to calculate the slope of each line and see which is 2/5; if more than
one have the right slope, then see which go through (0,3).

A better way to do it (since real life is not multiple choice) is to
find the equation  of a line through that point with that slope. Have
you learned the point-slope form? Then you can rearrange the equation
to standard form to compare with the four answers.

Please try writing the equation of the line as I just suggested, so I
can see how far you can get, and can help you do it right.
