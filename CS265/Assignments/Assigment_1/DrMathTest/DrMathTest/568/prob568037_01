Hello Kayonna,

There's not much to say about it.  In the (x,y)-plane, the usual formula for measuring the 
distance between two points p1=(x1,y1) and p2=(x2,y2) is 

d[p1,p2)=d[(x1,y1),(x2,y2)]=sqrt( (x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2].

This distance function or "metric" for the plane satisifies the following laws:

1. d(p1,p2) ? 0 for all p1 and p2; equality holds if and only if p1=p2.

2. d(p1,p2)=d(p2,p1) for all p1 and p2

3. d(p1,p2) ? d(p1,p3) + d(p3,p2) for all p1, p2, and p3

The third of these laws is called the triangle inequality.

The metric

D(p1,p2)=D((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) = |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|

satisfies these three laws.  It is the taxi cab metric.  It measures the distance between two 
points by adding the distances between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates.  This is 
the way a taxicab measures distance on a rectangular grid of streets.

If you do a search in Google, using

taxicab metric

you wil get many hits.
