ANY 6 numbers, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 have exactly the same 
probability of being drawn.  The tiny probability of this set of 
numbers occurring is simply a measure of the actual probability of 
any SPECIFIED 6 numbers occurring.  To most thinking people it is 
reason enough not to waste money on entering the lottery.
