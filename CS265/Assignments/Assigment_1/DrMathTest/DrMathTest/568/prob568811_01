Hi Katrina,

Assuming it's really written 

  30 divided by 5 times 2

then you've done the right thing: by convention, we do multiplications
and divisions in order, from left to right.  So 30 divided by 5 is 6;
and 6 times 2 is 12. 

For more on this convention, see

  Order of operations

Does this help?
