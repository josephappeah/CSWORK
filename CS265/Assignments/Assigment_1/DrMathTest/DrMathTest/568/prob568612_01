I think you were told to make a conjecture about the sum of any two
odd numbers based on the given examples, and then to prove it.

A conjecture is just a reasonable guess. Do you see any pattern in the
examples? Look at them all and think about which numbers are odd or
even. What do the sums seem to have in common?

Then, one way to prove your conjecture will be to write any odd number
as 2n+1, where n is some integer. What happens when you add two odd
numbers 2n+1 and 2m+1?

If you need more help, please write back and show me how far you got.
