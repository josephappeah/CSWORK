When we divide by a POSITIVE integer, we define the remainder as a
number between 0 and the divisor, or exactly 0. But that definition
doesn't work for a negative divisor. In fact, for a negative divisor
there are two different ways we can define the remainder (though they
will agree in your example). It might be either between the number and
zero, or between zero and the absolute value of the number.

See this page and the page it points to for some related issues in
computer programming:
