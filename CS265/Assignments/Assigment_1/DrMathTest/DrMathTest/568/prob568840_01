Hi Blake,

The best way for me to help you would be for you to write back 
with a specific problem or two that you haven't been able to solve, 
showing the steps you've tried to take on your own.  Then you and 
I can work through things one problem at a time, until you're back 
on track.

Would you like to give that a try?
