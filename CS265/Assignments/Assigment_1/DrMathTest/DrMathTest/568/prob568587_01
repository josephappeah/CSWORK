First, convert gallons to cubic feet (there are pages listed in our
FAQ to help with that), so you know the volume of the pool. That
volume, since it forms a rectangular prism (cuboid), is the length
times the width times the depth (height), so you can write an equation
using a variable for the depth, and solve for that variable.

If you need more help, please write back and show me how far you got.

By the way, a rectangle has no radius; is there some reason you used
that word in the subject line? I'm curious!
