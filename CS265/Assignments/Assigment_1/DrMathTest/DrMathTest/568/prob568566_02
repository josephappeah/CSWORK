Hi,

A deficient number is a number which is greater than the sum of its
proper divisors. The only proper divisor of 23 is 1, since 23 is
prime. Since 1 < 23, 23 is a deficient number.

In general, there isn't a math doctor checking all the messages coming
in. Most of us check the queue a few times a day. So, there is no
guarantee that you will get a response within minutes. Sometimes, you
may have to wait several hours or days before somebody gets to your
question. It's unfortunate, but as volunteers, we really do not have
the ability to get to every question immediately.
