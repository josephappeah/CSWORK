You've got it right. Let's work it out step by step:

First, divide 8 by 100. This comes out to 0.08.

Then add 1. Now we have 1.08.

Then divide 194.40 by 1.08; I get 180.

On a typical calculator that has parentheses (such as the calculator 
in Windows, in Scientific View), you can enter

  194.40
  divided-by
  (
  1
  +
  8
  divided-by
  100
  )
  =

You could also do

  1
  +
  8
  divided-by
  100
  =
  1/x
  *
  194.40

on any calculator with a 1/x (reciprocal) key.

Does this help? If it still comes out wrong for you, show me exactly 
what you are doing to get the wrong result.
