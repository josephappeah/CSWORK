Hi Jo Anne,

I noticed that Dr. Volger responded to your message at the same time I did, but our 
answers differ because our interpretations of when you are given money and when you 
must pay, are different.  In particular, I read your problem to mean that your money is 
doubled at the beginning of the day, and then you pay some amount before the end of 
that day, so we are interested in how much money you have at the end of a given day, not 
at the beginning.  I hope that this clears up any confusion you might have regarding our 
responses.

Furthermore, I would also like to mention that my response was not a formal proof, nor 
was it intended to be one:  certainly, it is entirely possible to derive from a completely 
computational standpoint the explicit formula describing the amount of money on a given 
day, as Dr. Volger adeptly illustrates.  My view was that I did not want to assume any more 
mathematical knowledge on your part than was absolutely necessary, but as you can see 
this is often at the expense of elegance, power, and a deeper understanding.

For these reasons, consider yourself fortunate--it's rare to have two Math Doctors write 
responses to a single question, and even rarer for them to arrive at a solution in different 
ways, so that you can see different levels of approach.
