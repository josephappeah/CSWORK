Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

You need to punch in 8.25% OR punch in 0.0825 (no percent). 8.25% is
equal to 0.0825. A rough guide to seeing if the calculation is correct
is to move the decimal place over 1 place on your cost.

So, for 11.50 --> 1.150. The sales tax should be slightly less than
1.15. 0.94875 is close enough that it is probably 8.25%.

One note of warning though: At least in different parts of Houston,
sales tax ranges from 8% to 8.75%. The base state sales tax rate in
Texas is 6.25%. The city, county, and other agencies add to this rate,
so the amount of sales tax you pay will vary from place to place in
the state.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
