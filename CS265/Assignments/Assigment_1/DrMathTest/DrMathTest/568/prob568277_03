This requires a lengthy delve into solution of cubic equations.  I 
will give a version of this below.  You will see that I have had to 
adapt it to the cubic that you quoted by putting P = -3H and Q = G.

The general cubic ax^3 + 3bx^2 + 3cx + d = 0 is changed to a simpler 
cubic without a term in x^2 by the substitution  y = ax+b  (or x = 
(y-b)/a) to get

    y^3 + 3Hy + G = 0

where  H = ac-b^2    G = a^2.d - 3abc + 2b^3

We now make use of the identity shown below, where w is a complex 
cube root of unity

  x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x+wy+w^2.z)(x+w^2.y +wz)

This is easily proved if you know how to factorize determinants, but 
if not, you can prove it the long way by multiplying out the 
factors, and remembering that w^3 = 1

The cubic is now expressed as 

   y^3 - 3pqy + p^3 + q^3 = 0    with  G = p^3 + q^3    H = -pq

So y^3 -3pqy + p^3+q^3 = (y+p+q)(y+wp+w^2.q)(y+w^2p+wq) = 0

and the three roots will be:

(1)    y = -p - q
(2)    y = -wp - w^2q
(3)    y = -w^2p - wq

So all that is required is that we have the values of p and q from 
the two equations 

          p^3 + q^3 = G     and     pq = -H

Here, think in terms of p^3 and q^3 rather than p and q, and 
consider instead the two equations

          p^3 + q^3 = G      and   p^3.q^3 = -H^3

Now we can see that p^3 and q^3 are the roots of the quadratic

    t^2 - Gt - H^3 = 0

and their cube roots must be chosen so that pq = -H

The roots of this quadratic are 

         (1/2)[G +-sqrt(G^2 + 4H^3)]

If G^2 + 4H^3 > 0   p and q are real and distinct

If G^2 + 4H^3 = 0   p and q are real and equal. The corresponding 
roots of the cubic are  -2p, p, p.

If G^2 + 4H^3 < 0   p and q are complex.  The cubic then, 
ironically, has 3 real roots.  In this situation it is better to use 
a trigonometrical method.
