Hi Brynn-Dafydd,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You have plenty of space left.  Some
people use "megabyte" to mean one million bytes.  Others use it to
mean 2^20 or

  1,048,576

bytes (which is slightly more than one million).  So you have at least
one hundred million bytes of space

  100,000,000

and you have used

  24,721

bytes, which is less than a tenth of one percent of your available
space, less than a fortieth of one percent in fact.  To get the number
of megabytes that 24,721 bytes is, divide by 1,000,000 or 1,048,576,
and you will find that you have used about 

  0.024721

or

  0.023576

of a megabyte, much less than one megabyte.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
