Hi, Kristy.

Did you try drawing a picture?  Generally in a problem like this,
you'll be able to find some right triangle, where you know either two
sides, or a side and an angle.  

If you know two sides, you don't even need a trig function.  You can
just use the Pythagorean theorem to find the other side.  

If you have a side and an angle, you need to set up the ratio of the
side you know and the side you _want_ to know, and that will tell you
what function to use. For example, if you know an angle and the side
opposite that angle, and you want to know the hypotenuse, use the sine
function:

               side opposite the angle
  sin(angle) = -----------------------
                   hypotenuse

Similarly for the other functions:


               side adjacent to the angle
  cos(angle) = --------------------------
                   hypotenuse

               side opposite the angle
  sin(angle) = --------------------------
               side adjacent to the angle


If you're in a trig course, this should all look pretty familiar to
you by now.  If it doesn't, this would be a good time to look at the
following item from our archive:

  Trigonometry in a Nutshell
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/53942.html

In your case, the picture of the situation would look like this:

                                       T
                                  .    |
                           .           |
                    .                  |
              .                        |
        E..............................H
        |                              |
  1.77m |                              |
        |                              |
        A------------------------------B
                     50.5m

     E = eye location
     B = base of tree
     T = top of tree
     H = point in horizontal line of sight

In triangle ETH, you know an angle (HET is 1.87 degrees), and you know
a side (EH is 50.5 meters).  So you can use those to find TH, and add
that the height of the observer (1.77m) to get the height of the tree.

Does this make sense?
