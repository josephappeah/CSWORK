You forgot to say which question you were referring to.  We get 
several hundred a day so you should identify the question or mention 
which doctor answered it.

Failing that I will give one method for finding the number of 
derangements of n numbers (that is no number in its correct 
numerical position) but it may not be the method given in the 
message you quote.

Number of Derangements of n Numbers (I am putting n = 10)
------------------------------------
For this we need to use the inclusion-exclusion principle (described 
later).  We first find the number of ways that 1 or 2 or 3 .... or 
10 numbers are in the correct position and then subtract this answer 
from 10!, the total number of possible arrangements.  In this way we 
get the number of arrangements with none of the numbers in the 
correct position.

Consider first that 1 particular number is in the correct position.  
This number can be chosen in 10 ways and the other 9 numbers can 
then be arranged in 9! ways (without regard to whether they are in 
correct positions or not).

 Total ways with 1 correct =  C(10,1) x 9!   then by similar 
arguments
 
 Total ways with 2 correct =  C(10,2) x 8!

 Total ways with 3 correct =  C(10,3) x 7!
 .........................................
 .........................................
 Total ways with 10 correct = C(10,10) x 0!
  
Then applying the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of ways 
with 1 or 2 or 3 or .... or 10 in correct position is

 n(1 or 2 or .... or 10 correct) =  C(10,1) x 9!
                                  - C(10,2) x 8!
                                  + C(10,3) x 7!
                                  ...............
                                  + C(10,9) x 1!
                                  - C(10,10) x 0!

  
    10 x 9!   (10 x 9)        (10 x 9 x 8)               10!
  = ------- - -------- x 8! + ------------ x 7! + ... - ----- x 0!
       1        1 x 2           1 x 2 x 3                10! 

  = 10!/1 - 10!/2! + 10!/3! - 10!/4! + ...... + 10!/9! - 10!/10!

  = 10![1 - 1/2! + 1/3! - 1/4! + ...... - 1/10!]

This is the number of arrangements with at least one number in the 
correct position, so the number with none in the correct position is

  10! - 10![1 - 1/2! + 1/3! - 1/4! + ...... - 1/10!]

       10![1/2! - 1/3! + 1/4! - ...... + 1/10!]

For purposes of symmetry this is more usually written in the form

  D(10) = 10![1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + 1/4! - ...... + 1/10!]

where D(10) stands for the number of DERANGEMENTS of 10 numbers, 
that is the number of arrangements with every number in a wrong 
position.

The extension to n numbers is obvious.

Below is a note on the inclusion-exclusion principle.  It is given 
in terms of probabilities, but is equally applicable to the number 
of ways that events can happen.

Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
------------------------------
It is easy to illustrate the principle with two or three 
probabilities using a Venn diagram.

For example with two overlapping probabilities P(A), P(B), we have 

   P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

The overlapping region is added in with P(A) and added in again with 
P(B), so to get it added in once only we subtract it, giving rise to 
the expression shown above.

With three overlapping probabilities P(A), P(B) and P(C) we get

P(A or B or C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) 
                 - P(A and B) - P(B and C) - P(C and A)
                 + P(A and B and C)

now the overlap of all 3 probabilities is added in 3 times by the 
first line of this equation, subtracted 3 times by the second line 
of the equation and so must be added in again by the third line.

The area corresponding to A and B BUT NOT C is added in twice in the 
first line and subtracted once in the second line, so it will appear 
once as is required.  Similarly for area B and C but not A, and the 
area corresponding to C and A but not B, each will eventually appear 
once only

With more probabilities the pattern continues and the proof by 
induction is not difficult but a little tedious.  The 
name 'inclusion-exclusion' describes exactly what is happening.  
Regions are being added a number of times and subtracted a number of 
times in such a way that each region occurs exactly once.
