Hi, Jessica --

It is easy to get confused over this....

There are no values of x for which |x| is negative; but in the 
expression "|x|", the "x" itself can be negative.

For example, if x = -10, then |x| = 10.  The "x" can be negative; 
but the "|x|" can't.

When you graph the solution to the inequality

  |x|>2

on a number line, what you are showing is the values of x for which 
|x| is greater than 2.  You aren't showing the values of |x| for 
which |x| is greater than 2.  So, for example, the value x=-10 
satisifes this absolute value inequality, because |-10|=10 is 
greater than 2.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
