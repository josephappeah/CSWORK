Hello, Chao --

The derivative only gives you the slope of the line at each point on 
the graph.  To find the equation of the tangent line at the given 
point, you need to

(1) evaluate the derivative for that value of x to find the slope at 
the given point; and
(2) find the equation of the tangent line at that point by using the 
point-slope form for the equation of a line, using the given point 
and the slope at that point as determined in (1)

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
