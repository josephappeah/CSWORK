Hi Terri,

Yeah, that's a pretty badly worded question.  Suppose the first test
has 20 questions, the second has 2 questions, and the third has 100
questions.  Then these percentages correspond to raw scores of 19, 2,
and 88 questions correct.  That's a total score of 109 for the three
tests.  But if the individual tests have different numbers of
questions, the total score would be different, while the percentages
remain the same. 

>This question would make more sense if it asked for an average of the

Yes, although not entirely.  If all the questions are supposed to have
the same weight, given the example I made up above, the combined
percentage for the three tests would be

  19 + 2 +  88   109
  ------------ = --- = about 89%
  20 + 2 + 100   122

On the other hand, if the tests are supposed to have equal weights,
then it _does_ make sense to average the percentages, which gives us a
different result:

   95 + 100 +  88   283
  --------------- = --- = about 94%
  100 + 100 + 100   300

So is the 'total score' supposed to be the number of questions
correct, or the number of 'points' (assigning each test a total score
of 100 possible points), or something else entirely?  There's no way
to know.  

This kind of reminds me of a story that Richard Feynman (the Nobel
Prize-winning physicist) told about his experiences reviewing
textbooks for the state of California.  What drove him nuts was
constantly running across problems like this, which were obviously
made up by people who didn't really understand the concepts involved.
His favorite example was something like:  

   Tommy and his father are looking at the sky one night.  
   They notice 3 green stars, 2 purple stars, and one red 
   star.  A green star has a temperature of 3000 degrees, 
   a purple star has a temperature of 4500 degrees, and a 
   red star has a temperature of 6000 degrees.  What was the
   total temperature of the stars that they were looking at?

Apart from the problems with specific details about star colors and
temperatures, it just makes no sense to ask about the 'total
temperature' of a collection of stars.  The question was obviously
made up by someone who was just trying to think of some context that
would produce numbers to add, without considering whether addition
made any sense for those numbers.  It looks like the same thing is
going on here. 

>Asking for a total score when all you have to work with 
>is percentages does not, in my opinion, lead to a meaningful answer 
>and actually seems to confuse the issue. 

We're in total agreement here.  But look on the bright side:  This is
a nice opportunity to discuss with your daughter the danger of
assuming that other people know what they're talking about, just
because they have degrees or titles, or happen to be in positions of
authority.  In the long run, that lesson is as important as anything
she's going to learn about mathematics. 

Does this help?
