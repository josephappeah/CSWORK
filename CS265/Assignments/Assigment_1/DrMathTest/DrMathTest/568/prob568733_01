This is the speed, so it goes in the miles per hour slot.  Except, you
have to convert from yards per minute to miles per hour.

Of course, given the speeds and times involved, it would be silly to
use miles and hours as your units of time.  Any time you multiply a
rate and a time, you get a distance.  All you really need to do is
make sure that you're using comparable units of time. 

For example, if someone is running at 264 yards per minute, and he
does that for 0.03 minutes, then he runs

  distance = rate * time 

           = 264 yards per minute * 0.03 minutes

           = 264 * 0.03 yards

           = about 7.9 yards

In ANY case, my advice is to forget about 'formulas', because relying
on formulas is an almost guaranteed way to get lost when you move to
problems where there _are_ no formulas - which is more or less all of
them after a while. 

It's better to concentrate on actually understanding what's happening.
 A picture can help with that.  We have a running back (R) who is 15
yards from a first down (F):

    R---------------------F
          15 yd

We have a linebacker (L) who is 15 yards away from the first down on
the other side:


    R-------------------->F<--------------------L  
            15 yd                   15 yd

They're both going to run at F, at different speeds, and we want to
know who will get there first.  Does this make sense so far? 

The running back runs at a rate of 264 yards per minute, and the
linebacker runs at 440 yards per minute.  

Now, without scrambling around trying to fit this into a 'formula', we
can think about various ways we might answer this question.  One would
be to ask:

   How much time will it take each guy to get to F?

Or, we might ask, 

   In the amount of time it takes R to get to F, can L 
   also get to F? 

Or we might ask it in other ways.  What we're always looking for is
the version of the question that will be _easiest_ to answer, because
that's largely what math is about - turning difficult problems into
easy ones.  (If no one has explained that to you yet, this would be a
good time to learn it.) 

I have a distance, and a rate.  The easiest thing to do is use the
definition 

  time = distance / rate

to find the time it takes R to get to F.  The distance is 15 yards;
the rate is 264 yards per minute.  So 

             15 yards
  time = ---------------
            264 yards
            ---------
              1 min

Note that the rate is a fraction, and to divide by a fraction, I
multiply by the reciprocal:


             15 yards * 1 min
  time = -------------------- 
                264 yards

The 'yards' in the numerator cancels the 'yards' in the denominator,
leaving me with 

  time = (15/264) min

       = 0.057 min

Now, you want to do the same thing for the linebacker, using his rate.  

And then you need to take into account one more fact:  The running
back gets a head start of 0.03 seconds.  So to stop the running back,
the linebacker has to get to F in at least 0.03 seconds LESS than the
running back. 

Does this make sense?
