Hi again, Anthony.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

In problem 1, the whole is the (entire) franchise.  The whole
franchise must be equal to the sum of its parts, so 

  1 = 5/12 + 1/4 + something,

and the something is what the equation is solving for.

In problem 2, the key word is "of".  In most mathematical problems,
this is interpreted as multiplication:

  35% of 200                 0.35 x 200
  half of a dozen            (1/2) x 12

and in your problem, note that "half of 3/4" is indeed (1/2) x (3/4)
= 3/8, and this is found by multiplication.

For future questions that are unrelated to old questions, it is
strongly preferred that you resubmit them as a new thread.  This
increases the chances that someone will respond, because if
you submit it as a followup to a previous question, most of the
Doctors on staff will defer to the previous answerer (i.e. me), and
so this reduces the number of people that can respond.
