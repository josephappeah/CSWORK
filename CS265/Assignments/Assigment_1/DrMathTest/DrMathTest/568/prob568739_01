Hi Felicity,

>i was wondering if you or someone else that you know, could tutor me 
>online?? 

We don't really do that.  But you might consider contacting Tutor.com,
which matches people up with with tutors who live nearby. 

We don't know of anyone who does extended online tutoring.

The way we usually work is to use specific questions as starting
points.  If you'd like to try writing back with a problem that you're
unable to solve, and show me what you've tried, I can work through it
with you.  

Would you like to give that a try?
