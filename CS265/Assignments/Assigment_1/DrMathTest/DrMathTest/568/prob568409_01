Hi William,

I think the following answer from the Dr. Math archive will tell 
you what you want to know: 

http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.number.glossary.html#palindromic

I found it by searching on these keywords:

  palindromic numbers

You can find lots of other similar answers by doing the same search at

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/mathgrepform.html

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
