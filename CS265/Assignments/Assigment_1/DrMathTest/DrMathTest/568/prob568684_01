Hi Melody,

You're right - 5 _is_ 20% of 25.  

A way to check that is to realize that 20% means the same thing as
20/100, and 20/100 is equivalent to 1/5.  So you're really asking: 5
is 1/5 of what number?  And of course, when you put it that way, it
seems clear that 25 is the right answer.

Does this help?
