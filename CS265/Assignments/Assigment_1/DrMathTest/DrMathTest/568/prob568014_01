a fraction is just a division that we haven't done yet.

Well, this isn't strictly true.  If you have a fraction like 3/5, and
you want to convert it to a percentage, you need to solve the proportion

  3    ?
  - = ---
  5   100

because a percentage is just a fraction with a denominator of 100. 
Note that we can solve the proportion by multiplying each side by 100,
to get

  3
  - * 100 = ?
  5

Now, we _can_ convert the fraction to a decimal, and do the
multiplication by 100.  But sometimes that's unnecessary, as in this case:

      3
  ? = - * 100
      5

      3 * 100
    = -------
        5

      3 * 20 * 5
    = ----------
          5

    = 3 * 20

    = 60 percent

The moral of the story is, there's hardly ever just one way to do
anything.

This is just wrong.  You don't rewrite it in fraction form and _then_
divide by 1000; you divide by 100 to get it into fractional form.

Let's say you have a percentage, like 12.5%.  To convert it to a
fraction, all you have to do is exchange the '%' for a denominator of
100, because 

  something
  ---------  and   something%
     100

are just two different ways of writing the exact same thing.  That is,
we just use the single character '%' to stand for the four characters
'/100'.  

So we can do this:

          12.5
  12.5% = ----
           100

and that _is_ a fraction.  Now, if we insist on having integers in
both the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by 10:

  12.5   10    125
  ---- * -- = ----
   100   10   1000

And you can simplify this if you want, but you certainly don't have to.  

>I just don't know how to explain what I know how to do.

I hate to have to be the one to break this to you, but if you can't
_explain_ how you do something, you don't actually know how to do it.
 You're just guessing. 

You can save yourself a lot of confusion about all this if you realize
that 

  1.  Decimals _are_ fractions, where the denominator is some 
      power of 10, which happen to be written in a very compact
      notation.  

  2.  Percentages _are_ fractions, where the denominator is
      100, but we use '%' to make the notation more compact.

  3.  A fraction is just a division that we haven't done yet. 

If you can't explain why those things are true to someone else, then
write back and we can talk about them some more.  For the most part,
if these things aren't crystal clear to you, then math is just going
to get more and more confusing as you get farther into it... which
would be a shame, because it should really work exactly the other way
around.  

Does this help?
