Hi Jason,

Let's try making a picture:


                         .
                      .  .
                  .      .
               .         . 30m
            .            .
    0/   .               .
    |                    .
   / \....................
              40m

Now, to represent the motion of the kite, we need to know what it
means for the kit to be 'moving away from you at 10 m/min'?  Does that
mean keeping the same angle with the ground?  


                             _
                            . | 10 m/min
                         .
                      .  .
                  .      .
               .         . 30m
            .            .
    0/   .               .
    |                    .
   / \....................
              40m

If so, then you need to let out line at 10 m/min.  Or does it mean
that the horizontal distance is increasing at 10 m/min, while the
vertical distance remains the same? 

                         . . . . . .> 10 m/min
                      .  .
                  .      .
               .         . 30m
            .            .
    0/   .               .
    |                    .
   / \....................
              40m

If that's the case, then you want to represent the distance to the
kite in terms of the (changing) horizontal distance and the (constant)
height (hint: trig functions are useful for this).  Once you have that
expression, you can compute the derivative to get the rate of change
of that distance, which is how fast you have to let out the line.

Does this make sense?
