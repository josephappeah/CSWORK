Hi, Steel --

You want to leave the equation in its current (factored) form.  In 
this form, the equation says that the product of 3, n, (n-4), and 
(2n+7) is 0.  The only way a product of several factors can be zero 
is if one of those factors is equal to zero.

So the equation in its current form is satisfied if

  3 = 0 (never...!); or
  n = 0; or
  n-4 = 0 (n=4); or
  2n+7 = 0 (n = -7/2)
