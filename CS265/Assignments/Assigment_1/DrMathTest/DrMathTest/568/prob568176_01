Hi, Hannah --

A subset is any set in which all the elements are elements of the 
given set.  So make a set by picking any or all (or none) of the 
elements of the given set and you have a subset of the given set.  
Note that it is considered a subset if you pick none of the 
elements; and it is considered a subset if you pick all of the 
elements.

In a set with n elements, the number of subsets is 2^n; thus in your 
example, with V having 4 elements, the number of subsets will be 2^4 
= 16.  The reason for this number of subsets is that, in picking the 
elements for the subset, you have 2 choices for each element -- you 
can either choose it or not choose it.

One way to list all the subsets of a given set is to use a "0" to 
indicate that an element is not chosen or a "1" to indicate that an 
element is chosen.  Then the subsets of the given set with n 
elements will correspond to the strings of n digits each of which 
is "0" or "1".  We can think of these strings as the binary 
representations of the integers from 0 to 2^n-1.

Here is this process of listing the subsets of a set containing 3 
elements.  If the original set is W={a,b,c}, then the subsets are

  subset  decimal  binary
  number  integer  integer  subset
  --------------------------------
    1         0      000    { }
    2         1      001    {c}
    3         2      010    {b}
    4         3      011    {b,c}
    5         4      100    {a}
    6         5      101    {a,c}
    7         6      110    {a,b}
    8         7      111    {a,b,c}

See if you can apply these ideas to your example where the given set 
has 4 elements.  Write back if you have any further questions about 
any of this.
