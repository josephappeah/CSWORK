You won't get exactly 88 combinations; I don't know why they chose 
that number. You'll have to look for a way to get at least 88.

One way to think of it is to represent each combination with a binary 
number, using 0 for a vanilla scoop and 1 for a chocolate scoop. The 
four pairs you list are then the numbers 00, 11, 10, and 01 (0, 3, 2, 
and 1). If you know enough about binary numbers, the answer is not 
too hard.

If the student does not know anything about binary numbers, then 
another approach is multiplication. With one scoop there are 
two "combinations"; with two, the second multiplies that number by 2, 
since for each choice of the first scoop, there are 2 choices for the 
second. Can you take it from there?
