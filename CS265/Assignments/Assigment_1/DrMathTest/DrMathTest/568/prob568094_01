Hi Sam,

Thanks for writing to Doctor Math.

To get the covariance from the correlation you must multiply by the 
two standard deviations of the individual data sets. Strictly, the 
standard deviations in this case are the square roots of the maximum 
likelihood estimators of the variances.

If you have a good statistics book look at how R is defined.

Write again if you need more help.
