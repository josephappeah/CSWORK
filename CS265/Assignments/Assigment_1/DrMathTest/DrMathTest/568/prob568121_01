Hi Eriq,

Actually, you don't need any variables to solve this. 

Let's pretend they have 100 employees.  (We can always scale the
result this gives us, so we don't give anything up this way.)

So we have 46 men, and 54 women.  

And we have 60 union employees.  70% of these are men. 10% of 70 would
be 6, so 7 times that is 42 union men.  Which means 4 non-union men. 
Let's summarize our results so far:

          Union     Non-union     Total

   Men      42         4            46

   Women     ?         ?            54

   Total    60        40           100

Can you fill in the missing values?
