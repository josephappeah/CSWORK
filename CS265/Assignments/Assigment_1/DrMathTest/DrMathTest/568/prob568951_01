Hi Brendan,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You seem to misunderstand function
notation.  When you have a formula f(x), think of the x as a 
"placeholder": if f(x) = x^2, think of this as saying that
"f(something) = something^2".

You are supposed to evaluate (f(a+h)-f(a))/h  , but when you write

>[(x^2+4x-3 + h) - (x^2+4x-3)]/h

your first term is f(x) + h, which is NOT f(x+h).  Also, you are 
supposed to evaluate f(a+h), not f(x+h).  If

   f(x) = x^2+4x-3 ,

or 
  
   f(something) = something^2 + 4*something - 3,

so

   f(a+h) = (a+h)^2 + 4(a+h) - 3 .

To compute f(a+h), you must replace each x in the formula by a+h.

Can you finish the problem now?  

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
