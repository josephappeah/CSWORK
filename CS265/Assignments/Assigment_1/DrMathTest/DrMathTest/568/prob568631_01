With a Poisson variable the number of events in a given period is 
independent of what happened in preceding intervals of time. 

    P(3 accidents in 2nd year and 0 accident in 1st year)
    -----------------------------------------------------
              P(no accident in 1st year)


Since the number of accidents in second year is independent of the 
number in first year this reduces to

   P(3 accidents in 2nd year)

If the average number of accidents per year is x then you require

  =  x^3/3! . e^(-x)
