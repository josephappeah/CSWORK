This isn't really a geometry question; it's about logical reasoning, 
which you have probably done all your life, but not in this formal 
way. Let's make it more informal and see if you can follow it better.

The conjecture (unproven statement) is this:

  If I have a negative number y, and then multiply it by any real
  number n, then the product yn is negative.

You are looking for a counterexample, that is, a pair of numbers y 
and n for which y is negative but the product yn is NOT negative. Can 
you find one?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
