Hello, Samuraix --

You are making this problem a lot harder than it is supposed to 
be....

Whenever you have an equation which say

  a+bi = c+di

where a, b, c, and d are real, the coefficients of the real parts 
must be equal and the coefficients of the imaginary parts must be 
equal.  So

  a+bi = c+di  ==>  a=c  and  b=d

In your problem, we simply have

  3x-4y+(6x+2y)i=5i

or

  (3x-4y) + (6x+2y)i = 0 + 5i

This means that we must have

  3x-4y = 0  [the real part must be equal]
  6x+2y = 5  [ the coefficients of the imaginary parts must be equal]

This is simply a pair of linear equations which you can solve by 
your favorite method.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
