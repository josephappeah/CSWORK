We say that 361 has a three-digit expansion (or representation) in 
base 10. The number of digits is not an inherent property of a 
NUMBER, but of a NUMERAL (a representation of a number in a certain 
base). When we just say it is a 3-digit number, we are implying "in 
base 10". Once you get talking about other bases, you have to make 
that explicit.
