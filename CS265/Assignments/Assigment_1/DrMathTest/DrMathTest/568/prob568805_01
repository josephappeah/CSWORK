Hi Mike,

Let's look at something similar, but a little different, just to
explore the concept. 

Suppose car A travels a mile at 60 miles per hour, while car B travels
a mile at 59 miles per hour.  If they're in a race, how much does car
A win by? 

At 60 miles per hour, car A travels 1 mile in 1 minute.  So 1 minute
is the time that car B has traveled when car A wins, right?  So we'd
like to know:  How far does car A go in 1 minute?

  59 miles    1 hour
  -------- * ---------- * 1 minute = 59/60 miles
   1 hour    60 minutes

So car A wins by 1/60 of a mile, or 1/60 of 5280 feet, or 

  1/60 of 5280 * 12 inches = 1056 inches

Basically, I used the time of the race to figure out the distance that
both cars traveled, and subtracted. 

Does this make sense?
