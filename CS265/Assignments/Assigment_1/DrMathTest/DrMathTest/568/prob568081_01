Hello Robin,

sin(ACB) = side opposite/hypotenuse = 3/5 = 0.6

So angle ACB = 36.87deg, approx.  I used ASIN on my calculator.

sin(BAC) = side opposite/hypotenuse = 4/5 = 0.8

So angle BAC = 53.13deg, approx.  I used ASIN on my calculator.  I could also have taken 
90 and subtracted angle ACB=90-36.87 = 53.13

As to the last part, 

1/2 x AB x AC x sin (then a triangle symbol with the right angle)BAC

I don't know what this might mean - maybe (1/2)*AB*AC*sin(BAC).  If this is a good guess, 
then

(1/2)*AB*AC*sin(BAC)=(1/2)*3*5*sin(BAC) = (15/2)*(4/5) = 3*2 = 6
