Hi Tim,

This will explain what an irrational number is:

  Real and Other Numbers
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57052.html

As for how to find out whether something is irrational, basically you
look at the decimal expansion and see whether it terminates or
repeats.  If it does either of those things, it's rational.  Otherwise
it's irrational.

Does this help?
