Hi Christine,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  What exactly do you mean by compare? 
Certainly you can say that those two quantities are fairly close,
which is a way of comparing.  If you mean decide which is bigger, then
no you cannot.  In fact, if the two quantities are

  2.0 m

and

  2.0 m

then you still cannot decide which is bigger.  What's worse, while it
is very probable that

  2.1 m

is smaller than

  2.2 m,

it is in fact quite possible that the opposite is true, since each has
an error in the last digit; some say that you should expect that last
digit to be off by 1 with a probability of about 30%.

Does that answer your question?  If you have any questions about this
or need more help, please write back and show me what you have been
able to do, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
