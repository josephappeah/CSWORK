Hi Ben,  

The first step in becoming a volunteer 'math doctor' is to
go through the short online tutorial that we've set up at 
 
  http://legacy.mathforum.org/volunteer/dr.math/signup.html

Enter your (full) name and email address, and select a sample 
question to answer.  The tutorial will make a series of suggestions, 
some of which may lead you to revise your initial answer.  At the 
end, your final answer will be forwarded to the Math Forum staff, 
who will contact you regarding the next step in the process. 

Thanks for volunteering!
