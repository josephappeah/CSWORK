Hi again Ruben,

Taking things too literally in mathematics is certainly not a 
problem - I would call it more like a gift.  You asked a very good 
question, one that most people would have probably never even 
thought about.  This is how a deeper unterstanding of math is 
developed, by asking and finding the answer to the hard questions, 
the questions that don't immediately "ring a bell" in your head.  I 
say keep up the good work.
