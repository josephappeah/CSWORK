The number of ways of getting a total of 20 is given by the 
coefficient of x^20 in the expansion of

  (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^4

  x^4(1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5)^4

   x^4(1 - x^6)^4
   --------------
      (1 - x)^4

 x^4(1 - x^6)^4.[1 + C(4,1)x + C(5,2)x^2 + ...+ C(19,16)x^16 + ..]

From this we have to pick out the various terms in x^20

Some tedious algebra produces the term  35.x^20  so there are 35 
ways in which a total of 20 can arise.  The total number of possible 
outcomes is 6^4 = 1296, so required probability

        35
    =  ----
       1296
