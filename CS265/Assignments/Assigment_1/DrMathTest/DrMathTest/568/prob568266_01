Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

It's the same probability as rolling exactly the sequence 1,5,4,2,3,
or 5,5,5,5,5, or any other exact sequence: 1/6^5 = 1/7776 = 0.013%.
The dice don't really care which numbers come up, so a 1,2,3,4,5 is
just as likely as 2,3,2,6,4. The only thing that distinguishes this
event is _our perception_ that this particular outcome is special. 

In other words, if we replaced the numbers on the die with "square",
"circle", "triangle", "star", "waves", and "rectangle", getting
"square, circle, triangle, star, waves, rectangle" in that exact order
would be just as likely as getting "star, rectangle, star, triangle,
triangle, square". It's only because we attach _extra_ significance to
the numbers and their order that it seems unusual.

At any rate, you have a 50% chance of any particular outcome
(1,2,3,4,5 or 6,6,6,6,6 or any particular _exact_ sequence of die
rolls) coming up in roughly 5390 rolls, since the probability of it
occurring on any given trial is 1/7776. You require 17904 trials to
have a 90% chance of this event happying once (though it will likely
happen most times before the full 17904). 

Using the negative binomial distribution, you should see any
particular outcome (say 1,2,3,4,5) twice with 95.5% probability after
roughly 50000 trials. 

Since the dice don't carry memory (they don't remember how they landed
last time and it doesn't affect future outcomes), time doesn't play a
role. In other words, the second time you see it is just as likely to
occur the very next time as it is 100000 trials from now.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
