"Patterns" can be a little vague, especially when I can't see the
sheet to know just what they are asking for. You mentioned an
equation; are you asked to write an equation with a variable for
finding the nth number in the sequence? And are there pictures showing
how these "patterns" are formed?

I think the picture for the problem you're working on (using "O" for a
block) would be

  OO   OOO   OOOO
  OO   O O   O  O
  OO   OOO   OOOO
  n=0  n=1   n=2
  ->6  ->8   ->10

There are two ways to approach the problem: you can work with what
changes when you increase n, or you can go more directly to the total
for any n.

The first way is to notice that the numbers 6, 8, 10, 12 are just
counting by 2. So when you increase n by 1, you add 2 to the number of
blocks. But is that apparent pattern real? Will it always happen just
because of the way you are adding blocks, or has it just worked that
way so far? To check, you have to look at the actual pattern. What
happens when you insert one more empty space? Here's what happens:

  OO*OO
  O + O
  OO*OO

I've added the empty space (shown as a "+") in the middle, and had to
add two more blocks (shown as "*") around it. And you can see that
this will always happen.

But how does this give you the equation for the number of blocks in
terms of n? There are ways to figure that out, but it takes some thought.

Let's try a more direct approach. Given some number n of empty spaces
(which I'll show as "+"), how do we build the pattern around it? We
can put a block above and below each space:

   OOO
   +++
   OOO

and then put three blocks each on the left and right:

  OOOOO
  O+++O
  OOOOO

So how many blocks did we need? We used 2 for each of the n spaces,
and 6 extra for the ends. Can you see how to turn that into an equation?

Your description of the pattern sounds like a nice alternative, though
I'm not sure how far you were able to take it. For n empty spaces, the
whole pattern is a rectangle 3 by n+2 (3 rows, with 2 more than the
number of empty spaces across). From that, and subtracting the number
of empty spaces, you could find the equation, though it takes a little
work!

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
