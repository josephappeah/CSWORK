Hi Ruben,

You are right when claiming that you don't break any mathematical 
rules, but the intercept form is considered simplified when neither 
x or y have a negative sign in front of them.  It is simply a 
convention made by mathematicians because it seems more "elegant" 
that way.

If you want to talk about this some more just write back.
