I'm not sure just what they would consider "common", but if you just 
convert the simplest fractions (say, 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, 1/3, 2/3, and 
maybe a few more) you can recognize a simple fraction that is close 
to the percentage given, and that is probably what you are looking 
for.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
