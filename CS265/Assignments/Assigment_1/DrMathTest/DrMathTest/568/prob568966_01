Hi Janet,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The E should be read "times ten to
the" as in "times ten to the power," and therefore it means to move
the decimal point that many spaces to the right (when the number is
negative, like yours, it means that many spaces to the left).  So your
number is

                              -17
  -2.77556E-17 = -2.77556 * 10
               = -0.0000000000000000277556

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
