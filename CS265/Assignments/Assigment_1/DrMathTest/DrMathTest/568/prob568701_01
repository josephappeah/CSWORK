First show that the statement is true for n = 5.

 That is 5! > 10 x 5

       120 > 50   -  Yes correct.

Now assume it is true for some value n=k.  That is we assume

        k! > 10k   Now increase n to k+1

We must show (k+1)! > 10(k+1)

           (k+1)k! > 10k + 10

           k.k! + k! > 10k + 10   we know k! > 10k  so we require

           k.k! > 10

and this is clearly true for n >= 5   

So if the result is true for n=k then it is also true for n = k+1.  
But it is true for n=5 so it will be true for n=6 anf if true for 
n=6 then true for n=7 and so on by induction to all positive 
integral values of n greater than or equal to 5.
