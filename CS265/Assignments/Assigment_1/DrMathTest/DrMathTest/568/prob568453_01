Hi, Melissa --

There are undoubtedly many different possible approaches to this 
problem; mine is perhaps a bit unorthodox, but it works for me.

I start the way you did:

  (x+1)(x+2) = x^2+3x+2

Then I know I need one more as-yet-to-be-determined factor to get my 
final expression, so I simply write

  (x^2+3x+2)(px+q) = 2x^3+ax-b

where I need to determine the required values of p and q.

Expanding the left-hand side and collecting like terms, we get

  px^3 + (3p+q)x^2 + (2p+3q)x + 2q = 2x^3 + ax - b

The coefficients of each power of x must be the same; so we have

  p = 2
  3p+q = 0

These two equations together tell us the values of p and q; once we 
have the values of p and q, it is easy to find the values of a and b:

  p = 2
  3p+q = 0  ==>  3(2)+q = 0  ==>  q = -6

Then (equating the coefficients of the "x" term and constant term)
 
  a = 2p+3q = 2(2)+3(-6) = 4-18 = -14
  -b = 2q = -12  ==>  b = 12

And then finally (to answer the question which was asked)

  a+b = -14+12 = -2

In actual practice, I don't really use the "p" and "q".  Instead I 
do something like the following:

  (x^2+3x+2)(?x+?) = 2x^3+ax-b

The "2x^3" on the right comes from the "x^2" times the "?x" on the 
right; this means the first "?" on the right must be a "2".  So now 
I have

  (x^2+3x+2)(2x+?) = 2x^3+ax-b

There is no x^2 term on the right; that means the coefficient of the 
x^2 term is 0.  The x^2 terms on the left-hand side come from "x^2" 
times "?" and "3x" times "2x"; so

  (x^2)(?) + (3x)(2x) = 0x^2
  (?)x^2 + 6x^2 = 0x^2

This tells me this second "?" must be -6.  So now I have

  (x^2+3x+2)(2x-6) = 2x^3+ax-b

Expanding the left-hand side, I find

  2x^3 + 0x^2 - 14x - 12 = 2x^3 + 0x^2 + ax - b

And so (again equating the coefficients of the x terms and constant 
terms) I have

  a = -14
  -b = -12  ==>  b = 12

and finally

  a+b = -14+12 = -2

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
