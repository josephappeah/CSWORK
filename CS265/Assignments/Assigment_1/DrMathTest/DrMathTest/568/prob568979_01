Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Remember that she counted 34 _more_ birds in the morning than in the
afternoon. If she counted 42 in the morning, then she counts 42+34 =
76 birds in the afternoon. But we know that's impossible.

Let's say that x is the number of birds she counts in the afternoon. Then:

   x+34 = # of birds counted in the morning

Since she counted a total of 76 birds:

   x + (x+34) = 76

Solving this equation for x gives you the number of birds she counted
in the afternoon.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
