Hi Avneesh,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  There are several errors in your 
friend's proof as you have stated it.  First, a quantifier in the 
statement is misplaced:

>suppose HK is invertible: 
>-> there exists a vector x in R^n such that:
>(HK)x = u, for every vector u in R^n

This says that there is one vector x in R^n which is mapped by HK onto
EVERY u in R^n.  The universal quantifier on u must go BEFORE the
existential quantifier on x: the x chosen will depend upon u.

Next, HK does not map R^n to R^n.  H is m x n and K is n x m, so 
HK is m x m, not n x n, and so HK is a mapping from R^m to R^m.

Finally, the proof nowhere uses the hypothesis that n < m, so it 
would apply to the matrices

  H = [ 1 0 1 ]     and   K = [ 1 0 ]
      [ 0 1 1 ]               [ 0 1 ]
                              [ 0 0 ] ,

for which its conclusion is clearly false.  It is essential that 
n be less than m.

You need to think about the rank of the matrices, and what this tells
you about their nullspaces and ranges.

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.

You sent your question in as if it were a follow-up to
a previous answer, asking for further clarification of
the answer or additional help on the problem.  However,
your question is really a new question, unrelated to
any previous answer.  Follow-up questions are directed
to the Doctor who originally answered the question, and
other Math Doctors will not usually look at the question.
If I am unavailable, your new question will probably not
be read or answered.  Please send in new questions as
such, and not as follow-ups.
