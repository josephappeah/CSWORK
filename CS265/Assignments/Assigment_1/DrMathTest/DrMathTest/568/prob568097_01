Hello Mary,

I probably can't help too much, since the way assessments are done is
using formulas that are determined by politics, not mathematics.
Presumably, the value of your property depends on both the acreage
you own, and on the size of the house.

But the actual formula could be almost anything.

There is one error above that I did notice, however.  One acre is
43560 square feet, so if you own 25.07 acres, then you own
25.07 x 43560 = 1,092,049 square feet.

But maybe this is what they're doing: they take the entire area of
the condo complex -- the buildings, not counting the land
outside (which may well be 156493 square feet).  If the area
of YOUR home is divided by that, you'll get the proportion
of the entire setup that you own.  That would be 1843/156493
= .011776, so you'd a little more than 1% of the total assessment.

Take the total assessment for the property, multiply by .011776
(= 1.1776%) and that's the total you'd owe for the year, so dividing
that by 12 would be your monthly payment.

If it's as straight-forward as that, then I don't see why they're
keeping the formula secret.

For things like this, it's hard to know what's "fair", since presumably
there are shared assets of the community, and they should be
divided up, too.  For example, suppose the next-door neighbors
have a house exactly twice as big as yours.  But you both love
to swim, so you both use the condo pool for 2 hours every day.

They might have twice as big a house, but you both get equal
enjoyment from the pool, so they maybe shouldn't pay quite
twice what you do.

Well, good luck with sorting it all out.
