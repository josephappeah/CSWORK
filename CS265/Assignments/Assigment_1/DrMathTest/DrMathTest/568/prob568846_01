Hi Aldo,

How you'd approach this depends on whether you know any algebra.  If
you do, you can set up an equation, based on the fact that if the
first number is n, then the second is (n+1), and the third is (n+2).
Then you get

  4080 = n(n+1)(n+2)

Actually, it's easier if you make n the middle number.  Then you get

  4080 = (n-1)n(n+1)

If you expand both, you'll see why the second is better. 

Anyway, if that looks like Greek to you, consider getting the answer
by trial and error.  Here are three consecutive numbers:

  3, 4, 5

The product is 

  3 * 4 * 5 = 60

which is way too small.  Here are three other consecutive numbers:

  80, 81, 82

The product is

  80 * 81 * 82 = 531,360

which is way too large.  So the answer is somewhere in between.  If
you're clever about guessing, you should be able to find the numbers
without too much trouble. 

Does this help?
