Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

These are _signed_ binary numbers. So, 11101101 = -19 (decimal) and
00110110 = 54 (decimal). The resulting number is -1026 (decimal).
Since the result is negative, your result should have 16 bits and
start with a '1'. Using 16 bit signed integers, the result is
expressed as:

    1111101111111110

It's the signed part of the numbers which makes basic multiplication fail.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
