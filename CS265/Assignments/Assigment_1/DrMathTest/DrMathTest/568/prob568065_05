Hi Joseph,

>y=27.109x^(2.651),where x is 30 then
>ln(y)=(2.651*ln(30))*ln(27.109) 

You are still not using logarithm properties.  y is a product, but
you are not using the product property of logarithms, which I gave 
you in my previous reply.  You are writing

   ln(a*b) = ln(a)*ln(b)

and that is not correct.
