Hi Dayo,

You start with an equation that gives you distance in terms of time,
for a given acceleration:

  s = at^2

If you have an error of 2% in acceleration, the value you might end up
with something anywhere between 

  s = (0.98a)t^2

and

  s = (1.02a)t^2

Similarly for the error in time.  

So you can get the highest and lowest possible 'wrong' values for the
distance, and compare those to the 'right' value.  

Is this enough to get started?
