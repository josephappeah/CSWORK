Hi Stephanie,

When you don't know where else to start, a good place to start is with
definitions, to make sure you understand the problem description. 

'Whole numbers' are integers beginning with 0:

  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...

'Consecutive' items follow each other immediately in some series,
e.g., Tuesday and Wednesday are consecutive days, March and April are
consecutive months, and so on.  And 11, 12, and 13 would be three
consecutive whole numbers; as would 12, 13, and 14; or 936, 937, and 938. 

So far, so good? 

Now, we can't have three consecutive whole numbers that _all_ equal
63, so presumably you mean something like 

   What are three consecutive whole numbers which, when
   added together, give a result of 63?

If so, then one thing you can do is start trying some set of
consecutive whole numbers.  The smallest set would be 

  0 + 1 + 2 = 3

which is smaller than 63.  Next would be 

  1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Still too small.  Next would be 

  2 + 3 + 4 = 9

Still too small, but do you see a pattern beginning to form?  Every
time we move the starting number up by one, we increase the sum by 3. 

So if we move the starting number by 10, we should increase the sum by
3, ten times, or by 30:

  12 + 13 + 14 = 39

Hey, it worked!  If we do it again, we go too far:

  22 + 23 + 24 = 69

But now you can come back down until you get a total of 63. 
 
Does this help?
