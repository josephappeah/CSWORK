Hi Regan,

There are two ways you might come at this.  One would be to start
looking for 6-letter words, and process them all the way we talked about.

A second way would be to collect 3-letter words, and then see which
letters they share.  In fact, you could construct a table in which you
list the three letter words containing each letter.  If you start with
the words CAT, DOG, BAT, HOG, PIE, FOR, ART, your table would look like

  A art bat cat 
  B bat
  D dog
  C cat
  E pie
  F for
  G dog hog
  H hog
  I pie
  J
  K
  L
  M
  N
  O dog for hog
  P pie
  Q
  R art for
  S 
  T art bat cat
  U
  V
  W
  X 
  Y
  Z

As you can see, some letters have many more candidates than others. 
After I've built up the table a while, I would want to look for the
letters that give me the most words, and then try to combine those
into a 6-letter word.
