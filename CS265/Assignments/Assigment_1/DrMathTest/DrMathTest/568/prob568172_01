Hi Ally,

Since you're told that x = 3 sin@, you can go ahead and make that
substitution:

    sqrt(9 - (3sin@)^2)

  = sqrt(9 - 9sin^2@)

  = sqrt(9*(1 - sin^2@))

Try simplifying this, and let me know what you get. 

>Write cos^3(x) * sin^4(x) in terms of cos(x)and its powers

Note that 

  sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1

             sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x)

Also note that 

  sin^4(x) = (sin^2(x))^2

Can you see how to replace the sin^4(x) term with something that uses
only cos(x) and powers of cos(x)?

Try solving 

  rcos@ = x

for cos@ in terms of r and x; then you can substitute into the first
equation to get something with only r and x in it.  

Similarly for the second equation.

Note that csc, sec, and cot can all be defined in terms of sin and
cos.  Find those definitions, and then substitute. 

>[Difficulty]
>I have always struggled with trig. I have no idea where to begin.

Where I usually begin is looking for places I can use substitution.  

For one thing, I hate functions like cot, so the first thing I do when
I see something like cot(x) is replace it with (1/tan(x)), and then I
replace that with (1/(sin(x)/cos(x)), which simplifies to
cos(x)/sin(x).  Similarly with sec and csc.  

Then, once I have everything expressed in terms of sine and cosine, I
start looking for patterns that might be useful.  Probably the most
useful pattern in 

  1 = sin^2 + cos^2

If sin^2 and cos^2 show up, I can replace them with 1, which is
guaranteed to make things simpler.  But if I have a lot of cosines,
and one sin^2, I can replace sin^2 with (1 - cos^2).  Or if I have
sines and one cos^2, the other way around. 

One very important thing to realize is that so long as you make
substitutions that are legal, there's no such thing as a _wrong_ step.
 There's no requirement that you take the shortest possible route from
a problem to its solution.  The most that can happen is that you might
wander around for a while.  But wandering is okay.  Wandering is how
you learn things.  

In the first problem above, I saw a square root, so when I see that, I
want to see if I can express everything inside as the product of
squares, since that allows me to get rid of the square root:

  sqrt(a^2 * b^2) = sqrt(a^2) sqrt(b^2)

                  = ab

Now, this might not have worked out.  If not, those are the breaks. 
I'm not worse off than I was before.  I've just got another possible
place to start from. 

Does this  make sense?
