Hi Premmi,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It looks like this should be extended as

  1^0   2^1   3^2   4^3   5^4   6^5   7^6   8^7
  --- + --- + --- + --- + --- + --- + --- + --- + ...
  7^0   7^1   7^2   7^3   7^4   7^5   7^6   7^7

is this the series you are referring to?  If so, then the term

  (n+1)^n
  -------
    7^n

will grow without bound, so the sum of all of those terms is certainly
infinite.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
