I hope the teacher didn't really say it that way. There are some 
tricky ways you can say something that sounds wrong, but is right if 
you interpret the words or symbols in an unusual way. But more 
likely, the idea is what is shown here:

  False proofs, classic fallacies
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.false.proof.html

That shows how you can do things in algebra that LOOK as if you were 
showing that 1=2 or something equally absurd, but if you look closely 
you discover they did something illegal. These false proofs are used 
to show why you have to be very careful when you do algebra.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
