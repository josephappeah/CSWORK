Hi Tom.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.

No, the set R = {0} is different from the null set S = Ø.
If you cannot read that symbol after the last equals sign, it is
a circle with a slash through it.

The number line with the point zero chosen (and no other point
chosen) is the set R.

The number line with NO POINTS chosen is the null set S.
