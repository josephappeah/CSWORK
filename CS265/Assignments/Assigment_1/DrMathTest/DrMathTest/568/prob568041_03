Okay, the problem is where I expected it to be. Please do what I 
asked, and show me some attempt to write an equation. I tried to 
guide you in this step, by asking a series of questions that should 
lead you to the equation for the first problem. If you answer those 
questions as far as you can, we can work together on the process you 
need to learn.
