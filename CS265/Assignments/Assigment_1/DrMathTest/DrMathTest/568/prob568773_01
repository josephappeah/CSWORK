Hello Jacqueline or Jackie,

Here is how to think about a problem like this: start at the word 
'number' in the sentence and work outwards from it to build an 
algebraic expression involving it.  

As you began in your 'thoughts', let's take the number to be n.  What 
do you see right next to 'number'?  Just before 'number', it says 
'twice a number', so that means 2*n.  Now you can restate the sentence 
as

   The sum of four and 2*n is 52.

Next, restate 'sum of' four and 2*n as '4 + 2*n'.  Finally, the 'is' 
means that you are supposed to state this as an equation:

    4 + 2*n = 52.

From here on, it's a matter of solving a linear equation in the 
unknown variable n.  There's lots of help in the Dr. Math library 
archives on that, if you need it.  For example, I found

by going to 

   http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/mathgrepform.html 

and searching for the words 

    single variable equation.

Please contact Dr. Math if you need further help.
