If you got the wrong answer, then you must have done something wrong. 
I wish I could be sure how to read the problem. I know it's hard to 
write an equation in e-mail, without math symbols. Is the problem 
this:

  log (2^(x/2)) = 3

where 2^(x/2) means 2 raised to the power (x/2)? If so, then I would 
first rewrite the left side:

  (x/2)*log(2) = 3

Now it's easy to solve. The answer isn't 6; you can't ignore log(2).

If the equation is different, write back and help me understand how 
to read the equation. If you can tell me the answer, that will help 
me confirm my understanding of how to read the equation.
