Hi Andrew,

I'm not sure what you mean by 'measuring angles at a distance'.  The
only angles you can _measure_ are the ones right next to you.  You
have to _calculate_ angles that are in the distance.  That's what
trigonometry is for.

Or perhaps I'm not understanding your question properly.  Can you give
me an example of an angle that you would want to 'measure at a distance'?
