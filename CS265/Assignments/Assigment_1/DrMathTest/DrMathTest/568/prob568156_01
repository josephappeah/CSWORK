There's a different way to express the dilations (stretching and
shrinking) that makes the two look more similar.

Say we have an equation

  y = f(x)

(I'm assuming you know about function notation.)

If you stretch the graph vertically by a factor of k, the new y will
be k times what it was for a given x:

  y = k f(x)

But you can also think of it as replacing y in the original equation
with y/k:

  y/k = f(x)

That means that y for the new equation has to be k times as great as
in the original equation, in order to be on the graph; dividing it by
k gives you the equivalent "y" in the original equation, which is why
we replace y with y/k to get the new equation.

Now let's stretch horizontally by a factor of k. That can be done by
replacing x with x/k this time:

  y = f(x/k)

And that is what you were asking about.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
