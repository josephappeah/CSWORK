Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The sum of the lengths of the two smaller sides is always greater than
the length of the third side. There's a really simple experiment you
can try to see this for yourself.

Take 3 pieces of wire or sticks or something else that's straight.
Make the lengths of 2 pieces sum to the length of the 3rd piece and
see if you can form a triangle. Next, make the sum of the lengths of
the 2 pieces longer than the length of the 3rd piece and see if you
can form a triangle.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
