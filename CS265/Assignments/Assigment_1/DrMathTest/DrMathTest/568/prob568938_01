Hello Suzie,

3.5 sq ft can be converted into square yards; just divide by 9 (because 1 sq yd is 9 sq ft).  
So,

3.5 sq ft = 3.5/9 sq yd = 0.388... or 0.39 sq yd, approximately.

I'm not certain if I know what you mean by "into 1 yard by 56 in."  If I understand this, you 
have something that is 1 yd by 56 in, which is 1 yd by 56/36 yd, which is equal to 
56/36 sq yds or about 1.6 sq yds.  You can't turn 0.39 sq yds into 1.6 sq yds.
