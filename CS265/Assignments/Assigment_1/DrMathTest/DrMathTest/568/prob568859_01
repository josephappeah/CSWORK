Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

1) How big a hole? If you mean a normal sized hole, you'd simply have
a hole. Unless you are asking about conditions at the center of the
earth, that's about the best answer you can get.

2) The past (by less than a second). Time zones are a way for people
to have clocks that match their "local" time. In other words, if it is
midday in the central part of the United States, it's night time in
Australia. Since everybody likes "noon" to be midday, we have time
zones. In other words, time zones are things people invented. They
don't really reflect the real world. As such, your image in a mirror
is composed of photons which reflected off of you a very brief moment
ago. Since light travels so fast, even the furthest mirror would give
you a reflection that moved along with you.
