Which is one way of defining it.  Not the only way.

It's 'wrong' in the same sense that
        _
  2 = \/4

is 'wrong', which is to say, it's incomplete.  The analogy with
complex numbers is to say that

  2^2 = 4 

and therefore 
    _
  \/4 = 2

But 2 is not the _only_ number whose square is 2.  There is another
number, i.e., 

      _ 2      _ 2
  (-\/4)  = (\/4)  = 4

Similarly, when we say that 

        __
  i = \/-1

we mean that it is one of _two_ numbers that, if squared, will produce
-1, i.e., 

      _ 2      __
  (-\/i)  = (\/-1) = -1

or 

     2       2
  (i)  = (-i)  = -1

Dr. Pete was just trying to show that you can define imaginary numbers
without talking about square roots; not that you can't use square
roots to define imaginary numbers.

If we want to avoid using square roots, we can note that the equation

     -4 = x^2

is satisfied whenever x = 2i or -2i, where i^2 = -1.  That is, 

  (2i)^2 = (2)^2 (i)^2

         = (4) (-1)

         = -4

and

  (-2i)^2 = (-2)^2  (i)^2         or     (2)^2 (-i)^2

          = (4) (-1)                     (4) (-1)

          = -4          

There's no contradiction that arises from using square roots.  We just
have to be careful to realize that - just as with real numbers - using
a square root only shows us half the story, and we always have to be
aware of the other half, so we can consider whether ignoring it will
cause us problems. 

It's a little like using 'parent', which also has two values.  Suppose
Alex is the child of Pat and Chris.  Chris, but not Pat, plays the
piano.  If I'm not careful, I might say something like 

  Chris is the parent of Alex.
  Chris plays the piano.
  Therefore, the parent of Alex plays piano. 
  Pat is the parent of Alex.
  Therefore, Pat plays the piano. 

Which, of course, is wrong.  We go astray in the third step, where
instead of 

  the parent of Alex plays piano

we ought to say

  ONE OF THE PARENTS of Alex plays the piano

The most we can derive from that is that 

  Pat or Chris, or both, plays the piano.  

The moral of the story is that if you start with a true statement
about x, such as 

  x^2 = -4

and you want to transform that into another statement about x, by
taking square roots, you have to remember that there are _two_ square
roots.  Sometimes that fact is important; other times, it can be
ignored.  But it must always be considered.
