Hi DJ,

Instead of 'columns', which are abstract, why not try 'bags'?  Get out
enough small objects (cookies, sugar cubes, mints) to make all the
2-digit numbers.  

Now, make some big pile, and think about how to count the number of
objects in it.  If you have some ziploc bags, you can do this:  count
out 10 items, and put them in a bag.  Count 10 more, and put them in
another bag.  Keep doing that until you can't fill any more bags. 

Now you have some number of bags, and some number (less than 10) of
individual items.  What number describes this whole thing?  The 'tens'
digit is the number of bags with 10 items each!  And the 'ones' digit
is the number of items that couldn't fill a whole bag.  

Now start adding an item at a time to the pile.  Maybe you started
with 4 bags and 7 items.  You get

   4 bags and 8 items.
   4 bags and 9 items.
   4 bags and 10 items.

Ah, but now you can fill another bag!  So that's really 

   4 bags and 8 items.
   4 bags and 9 items.
   5 bags and 0 items.      <--- 4 bags and 10 items.

Now you can continue:

   4 bags and 8 items.
   4 bags and 9 items.
   5 bags and 0 items.      <--- 4 bags and 10 items.
   5 bags and 1 item.
   5 bags and 2 items.

For fun, you might then talk about what should happen when you have 9
bags and 9 items, and you want to add another one?  

Does this help?
