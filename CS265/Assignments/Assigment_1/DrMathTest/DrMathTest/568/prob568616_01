Hi Kassendra,

Thanks for the question.

As you rightly say, any (non-vertical) line can be represented by 
the equation:

           y - y1 = m(x - x1)

Where m is the gradient (slope) and two points it passes through are 
(x, y) and (x1, y1).

If we use the point we're given, (-1, 4), we can get:

  y - 4 = m(x + 1)

We can't put in m at this stage, though. To do that, we need to find 
the gradient of 2x + 2y - 5 = 0.

We can do that in a number of ways. One way would be to find two 
points that the line passes through and put them in the above 
equation to find m. A simpler way, however, is to use the equation:

 y = mx + c

Where m is the gradient, and c is the x-intercept.

If we rearrange the equation 2x + 2y - 5 = 0 so that it's in terms 
of y, we should be able to find m:

  2x + 2y - 5 = 0

           2y = -2x + 5

            y = -x + 2.5

So the gradient is -1 (and the x-intercept, not that we care, is 2.5)

So if we substituted -1 into our original equation, we would get:

  y - 4 = m(x + 1)

  y - 4 = -(x + 1)

This is the line that goes through (-1, 4) and is _parallel_ to 2x + 
2y - 5 = 0. We want the line that goes through (-1, 4) and is 
perpendicular to 2x + 2y - 5 = 0. To rotate a gradient about 90 
degrees, you take the negative reciprocal.

So, for example, the gradient perpendicular to a gradient of 1/2 is -
2.

Therefore, the gradient perpendicular to a gradient of -1 is 1.

Therefore our equation is:

  y - 4 = x + 1

Now, we rearrange that into standard form:

      0 = 4 + x + 1 - y

      0 = 5 + x - y

This answer is different from that of the review. Are you sure the 
question is copied correctly?

There's a page with more information about linear graphs here:

    http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/63134.html

Does that help? 

Write back if I can be of any more help - on this or anything else.
