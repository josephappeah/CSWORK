I wouldn't expect you to find one formula for this; you need to 
figure out how to break the problem into steps, each of which can be 
solved by a formula.

What do you need to know in order to find the perimeter of a sector? 
You may not have a specific formula for the perimeter of a sector 
either, but it's generally easy to write your own formula for the 
perimeter of a shape: it's just the sum of the lengths of the sides. 
What, besides the radius, would you like to know so that you could 
find the perimeter?

Then, as a second step, consider how you can calculate this quantity 
that you need, in terms of the given information.

Once you've planned the two steps, you can execute them -- in reverse 
order to the way I proposed that you plan them. (This planning method 
is goal-driven: deciding what is needed to reach the goal.)
