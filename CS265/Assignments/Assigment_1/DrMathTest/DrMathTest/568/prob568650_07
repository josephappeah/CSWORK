Hi F,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I saw your discussion with Dr Ian, and
when I understood exactly what it was you were looking for, I was
really fascinated.  I was actually more fascinated by that pattern you
found, and I'd like to tell you what I learned about it, but first I
will stop to answer you question:

You have an integer x (x = 10 in your problem), and another integer N
(this is the 14x^2 + 75x + 81 = 2231 in your problem), and you want to
find some triple (a, b, c) such that

  ax^2 + bx + c = N

and

  b^2 - 4ac = m^2

is a perfect square.  The obvious thing is:

  Pick a.
  Pick b.
  Set c = N - ax^2 - bx.
  See if b^2 - 4ac is a square.
  If not, start over.

That's probably what your computer program did, and then you started
noticing the patterns.  But we wonder if there is an easier way.  So
let's look at those formulas we had again, much like Dr Ian was
suggesting earlier:

  c = N - ax^2 - bx
  b^2 - 4ac = m^2

So we substitute c into the second equation and get

  b^2 - 4a(N - ax^2 - bx) = m^2
  b^2 + 4bax + 4a^2x^2 - 4aN = m^2
  (b + 2ax)^2 - 4aN = m^2
  (b + 2ax)^2 - m^2 = 4aN
  (b + 2ax + m)(b + 2ax - m) = 4aN.

At this point, we start to think that there are a lot of solutions;
all we have to do is pick any number for a and then look at all of the
ways that 4aN can be factored into two even numbers, and solve for b.
 To find one solution easily, we can factor 4aN into 2a*2N:

  b + 2ax + m = 2N
  b + 2ax - m = 2a

and then solve for b and m

  b + 2ax = N + a
  b = N + a - 2ax
  m = N - a

So you can pick any number you want for a, and then let

  b = N + a - 2ax
  c = N - ax^2 - bx

and then you have

  ax^2 + bx + c = N

and

  b^2 - 4ac = (N - a)^2.

This isn't always a small solution, but it's always an integer solution.



Now, with your first question answered, recall that I said I thought
that pattern you found in your solutions was really interesting.  So I
thought about it some more.  This might make using the answer found
above easier than before.  I did a little algebra and determined that:

If ax^2 + bx + c = N and b^2 - 4ac = m^2 is one known solution to your
problem (a, b, c, x, N, and m are all integers), then let

  r = 2ax + b - m
  s = 2c - 2ax^2 + 2mx

and then divide r and s by their gcd (so that r/s is in reduced form),
and then let

  t = -(rx^2 + sx)
  n = 2rx + s

and then we have infinitely many more solutions, given by

  (a + rk)x^2 + (b + sk)x + (c + tk) = N
  (b + sk)^2 - 4(a + rk)(c + tk) = (m + nk)^2

for all integers k.

In your problem, x = 10, N = 14x^2 + 75x + 81 = 2231, and your
solution of (a, b, c) = (18, 41, 21) with m = 13 gives

  r = 388
  s = -3298

which can be reduced to

  r = -2
  s = 17

by dividing both by -194, and that gives the other solutions

  (a, b, c) = (18 - 2k, 41 + 17k, 21 + 30k).

What's interesting is you can also change the sign of m and get a
completely different set of solutions.  Using your (18, 41, 21) with m
= -13 gives

  r = -9
  s = 83

and

  (a, b, c) = (18 - 9k, 41 + 83k, 21 + 70k).

It turns out that these are the only two ways to get a string of
solutions with a common difference, but you can use one way to
generate infinitely many solutions, and for each of those new
solutions you can change the sign of m and get a whole new string of
solutions!

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
