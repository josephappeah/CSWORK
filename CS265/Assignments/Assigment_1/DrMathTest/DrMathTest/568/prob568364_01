Hi Kent,

I'm not sure what you mean.  If the probability that something works
on a given try is 99%, the probability that it will work AT LEAST once
in some number of tries increases as the number of tries increases. 
So it will never be below 99%. 

Can you tell me more about the problem you're trying to solve?
