Hi,

Yes, you could do that.  How many times would you have to use the scale? 

Or you might do something like this:  Put 5 stacks on each side, and
see which side is lighter.  You know the fakes are on that side, so in
one weighing, you've eliminated half the possibilities. 

If you can eliminate three more possibilities with one more weighing,
then you're down to two stacks, and a third weighing will tell you
where the fakes are...  Think about how you might do that, and let me
know what you come up with. 

(Hint - you might not want to put _all_ the stacks on the scale every
time...)
