Basically, if you watch the movement of a point and its image
through a lens, as you move the point toward the lens, the
image moves away and vice-versa.

If the point is 2f from the lens on one side, the image is at
2f on the other.  If the point is closer than 2f on one side,
the image will be farther and vice-versa.

I'm not positive I've understood your question yet, but maybe
this will help.
