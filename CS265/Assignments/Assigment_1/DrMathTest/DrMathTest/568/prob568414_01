Hi Brad,

Given the numbers from b to e, we can add them in opposing order, 

  b  b+1   b+2   ...  e-2   e-1   e

  e  e-1   e-2   ...  b+2   b+1   b
 
If we add these up, 

  b    b+1   b+2   ...  e-2   e-1   e

  e    e-1   e-2   ...  b+2   b+1   b
  ---  ---   ---        ---   ---   ---
  b+e  b+e   b+e        b+e   b+e   b+e

we get (e-b+1) terms, each of which sums to (b+e).  And that's twice
the sum we're looking for.  So the sum is

  (b+e)(e-b+1)/2

If b=1 and e=n, we get the sum of the first n positive integers, 

  (1+n)(n-1+1)/2 = n(n+1)/2

Note that if we represent each number from 1 to N this way, 

  *
  **
  ***
  ****
  *****

we can double the triangle to get

  *@@@@@
  **@@@@
  ***@@@
  ****@@
  *****@

so the sum we're looking for is just half the area of the rectangle,
or n(n+1)/2. 

Is this the formula you found?  If so, how did you come up with it? 
Even though the formula is known, new ways of deriving it are interesting.
