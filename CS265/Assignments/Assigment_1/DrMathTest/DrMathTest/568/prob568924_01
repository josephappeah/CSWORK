Hi Josh,

There's no 'procedure', per se.  What there is, is the rule that if
you have an equation that's true, you can do anything to both side
(except divide by zero) and it will still be true. 

So if I assume that 

  k = mt + 2

is true, then I can add 1 to both sides, 

  k + 1 = mt + 2 + 1

and it will STILL be true.  Does that make sense?  Or I could multiply
 both sides by 3, 

  3(k + 1) = 3(mt + 2 + 1)

    3k + 3 = 3mt + 6 + 3

and it will STILL be true. 

Now, most of the things I _can_ do to an equation won't really be all
that helpful.  But it's very, very important to realize that
'unhelpful' is not at all the same as 'wrong'.  If I take some steps
that are unhelpful, but correct, the worst that can happen is that it
will take me longer to get to the answer than it might otherwise. 

So let's look at 

  k = mt + 2

again.  Let's consider some things we might do.  

  Subtract k from both sides:

    0 = mt + 2 - k                 

  Subtract mt from both sides:

    k - mt = 2

  Subtract 2 from both sides:

    k - 2 = mt

  Divide both sides by k:
  
    1 = (mt + 2)/k

Of these, the most promising one seems to be subtracting 2 from both
sides.  Why?  Because I've almost got m by itself, which is what I
want.  So it looks like a step in the right direction. 

So, starting from 

  k - 2 = mt

what things might you try?  Do any of them lead you closer to a solution?
