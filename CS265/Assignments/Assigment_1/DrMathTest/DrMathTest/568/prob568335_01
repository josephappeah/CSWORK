I believe short word form is essentially what you used (I'd write it
as 137 thousand, 294); but that's the value of the whole number, not
just the underlined digit.

The value of the 4 is 4; the value of the 9 is 90; the value of the 2
is 200. What is the value of the 3?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
