Hi Angie,

It already _is_ a fraction.  A decimal is just a very compact way of
writing a fraction, where the denominator is a power of 10, e.g., 

  0.1 = 1/10

  0.12 = 12/100

  0.123 = 123/1000

  0.004 = 4/1000          <-- the number of zeros in the denominator
                              is the same as the number of decimal
                              places

So 0.6 is the same as 6/10. 

Does this help?
