Hi Joey,

Suppose I'm trying to subtract 24 from 52, and I'm feeling confused. 
I might note that if I add 6 to both quantities, I get

  (52+6) - (24+6)

which should give me the same amount.  (Do you see why?)

Why would I do that?  Because then I can solve my problem by
subtracting 30 from 58, which is very easy, compared to the original
problem. 

Basically, when I look at 24 and 52, I think:  Man, this would be so
much easier if the number I'm subtracting was a nice round number. 
Hey!  I can _make_ it a round number by adding 6 to it.  And as long
as I add 6 to the larger number, I'm golden. 

Does this make sense?
