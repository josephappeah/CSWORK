Hi Cat,

As a first step towards getting comfortable with letters, you might
consider using whole words.  Instead of writing

  c = p + r(p)

write

  total_cost = price + tax_rate*price

You're told the price ($34.99), so you can replace 'price' with that
value wherever it occurs:

  total_cost = 34.99 + tax_rate*34.99

And you're told the tax rate (6%), but to use that properly, you need
to understand that 

  something%

is just a shorthand for the fraction

  something/100

and that when we write something in decimal notation, we're just
writing the numerator of a fraction with a power of 10 in the
denominator, e.g., 

    0.1 = 1/10

   0.12 = 12/100

  0.123 = 123/1000

   0.06 = 6/100           <- Then number of zeros in the denominator
                             is the same as the number of decimal
                             places.

So to use a rate of 6% in the problem, we have to write it as 6/100,
or 0.06.  That gives us 

  total_cost = 34.99 + 0.06*34.99

And now we just have some operations to evaluate. 

Does this make sense? 

>well i first wrote out the problem: 
>c=p+r(p) then i replaced the letters with numbers
>c=$34.99+.06($34.99) then i multiplied the pecent an the price
>c=$34.99+2.1 then i added and i got 
>c=$37.09   please get back to me asap

Note that you can use the distributive property to make this a little
simpler:

  c = 34.99 + 0.06*34.99

    = 1*34.99 + 0.06*34.99          This looks a little weird, but 
                                    it makes the next step clearer...
    = (1 + 0.06)*34.99

    = 1.06 * 34.99

    = 37.0894

    = 37.09 (rounded to the nearest penny)

So you were exactly right.  Can you tell me why you thought you might
have been wrong?
