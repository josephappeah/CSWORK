Hi Anne,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Actually, you have the answer.  u and
v are just names for coordinates in the image space, which you are
using to distinguish images T(v) from vectors v in the domain of T,
whose coordinates or components are designated by x and y.  However, 
you have observed that v = 2u, so if you just change the names of
the coordinates from (u,v) to (x,y), this becomes y = 2x.

An alternative way of computing this is to write the given line in
parametric form, which can always be done by first finding a point on 
the line (e.g. (0,3) or (2,0)), and then using x as the parameter:

  x = t, so y = (6-3x)/2  becomes y = 3 - (3/2)t.

Then any point on the given line is

   [ 2 ]    [   1  ]
   [ 0 ] + t[ -3/2 ] ,

and you can compute a parametric form of the image line by

  [ 1 2 ]([ 2 ]    [   1  ])   [ 1 2 ][ 2 ]    [ 1 2 ][   1  ]
  [ 2 4 ]([ 0 ] + t[ -3/2 ]) = [ 2 4 ][ 0 ] - t[ 2 4 ][ -3/2 ]

which gives you a parameteric equation of the line.

Actually, note that this relationship doesn't depend in any way on
the given line.  The image under T of every vector in R^2 lies on 
line y=2x, which is a subspace of R^2, since it is a line through 
the origin.  So in fact, every line in the plane is mapped onto
this line (y=2x).

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
