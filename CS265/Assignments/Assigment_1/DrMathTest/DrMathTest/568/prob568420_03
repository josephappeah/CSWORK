Hello Kodees,

The method 

"interest rate 18% for 12 months is 1800 (for principle - 10000)
i calculate 11800/12 (983.33) is the monthly due (he is going to pay 
the principle and interest in 12 dues)"

is not standard practice in the U.S."  The calculations I outlined in  my first note are 
standard practice (although sometimes modified slightly by some banks).

For the standard method, one can calculate principle and interest each  month because 
interest is calculated on the amount owed during each month.

In your method, the interest is calculated once, on the entire amount, added to the 
amount borrowed and then paid back in 12 installments.  It makes no sense to me to try 
to figure out the "higher" interest you refer to when you say "so the interest rate is higher 
than the actual 18%."

I'm sorry but I can't help you with your calculations.
