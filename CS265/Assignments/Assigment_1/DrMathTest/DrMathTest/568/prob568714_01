I'll show you what I do, using "unit multipliers" -- fractions in 
which the numerator and denominator are two names for the same 
quantity. An example of a unit multiplier is

  2.2046 lb
  --------- = 1
     1 kg

You effectively used this in your first calculation:

  0.145 kg   2.2046 lb   0.320 lb
  -------- * --------- = --------
    1 m^2       1 kg       1 m^2

We can keep going, using the unit multiplier

  0.3048 m
  -------- = 1
    1 ft

Since a square meter is a meter times a meter, I can do it like this:

  0.145 kg   2.2046 lb     0.3048 m
  -------- * --------- * (  ------- )^2 =
    1 m^2       1 kg          1 ft

  0.145*2.2046*0.3048^2 lb/ft^2

You can do the arithmetic. The thing to notice is that the kg in the 
numerator and the denominator "cancel" just like numbers, and the two 
factors of m in the numerator cancel with the m^2 in the denominator. 
What's left is lb in the numerator and ft^2 in the denominator, so 
the final units are lb/ft^2. That's what's nice about this conversion 
method: if you do it right, the units come out right, so you can be 
sure you didn't multiply when you should have divided or vice versa.
