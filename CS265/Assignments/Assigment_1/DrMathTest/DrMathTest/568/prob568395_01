Hi vita,

I think the following answers from the Dr. Math archive will tell 
you what you want to know: 

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52990.html
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/53039.html

I found them by searching on these keywords:

  inverse function  (phrase)

You can find other similar answers by doing the same search at

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/mathgrepform.html

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
