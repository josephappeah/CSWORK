You can write two equations with two variables, L and W, and solve 
for them.

If you use trial and error, note that since the perimeter is odd, the 
length and width can't both be whole numbers. That complicates things!

Another consideration is to see what the perimeter would be for a 
square with the given area. If you know something about how 
perimeters relate to areas, that will tell you something important.

If you need more help, please write back and show me how far you got.
