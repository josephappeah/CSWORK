Hi William,

It's rarely important to do this, and that's why the normal angle
convention usually works fine, but as you've noted, sometimes
there is a problem.

When it is critical to discuss angles and reflex angles at the same
time, a common approach is to make sure the reader knows to
pay attention, and then to use "directed angles".  If the angle
<ABC is directed, that means that (as usual) B is the vertex,
but the ray BA is the first ray and the angle goes counter-clockwise
from BA to BC.  Thus if <ABC is one angle, then <CBA is its
reflex angle.
